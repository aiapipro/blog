### Summary
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science dedicated to solving cognitive tasks that normally require human intelligence. This can encompass anything from language translation and visual perception to complex decision making. The ultimate objective of AI is to create machines that can mimic human intelligence.

### ELI5
Imagine you have a toy robot and you want it to clean your room. But the robot doesn't know anything. Artificial Intelligence is like teaching the robot to learn how to clean up, recognize your toys and the best way to organize them, over time without your continuous instructions.

### In-depth explanation
Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a branch of computer science striving to create intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that usually require human cognition. These tasks include, but are not limited to, voice recognition, learning, planning, problem-solving, perception, and language translation.

AI systems are often categorized into two fundamental types: narrow AI, which is designed and trained for a specific task (like voice recognition), and general AI, which has broad abilities akin to human intelligence. As of now, what we have mostly are systems falling under the narrow AI classification, and the creation of true general AI represents a huge ongoing research challenge.

Underlying fields and methods contributing to AI include machine learning, where systems are endowed with the ability to learn and improve with experience. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, utilizes neural networks with many layers (hence the 'depth') to model and understand complex patterns in data.

AI has the potential to revolutionize a multitude of fields, including healthcare, transportation, entertainment, and many others. But alongside these benefits, it also presents myriad ethical, legal, and social challenges that society needs to address. This includes issues around privacy, fairness, accountability, and transparency, among others. Developing guidelines and frameworks to ensure AI is used ethically and responsibly is also a key part of the field.
