### Summary

"Spatial-Temporal Reasoning" is about understanding and deducing the relationships, operations, and transformations in space and time. It's a core capability for many AI applications, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and video analysis, where understanding how things change and move is crucial.

### ELI5

Imagine you're watching your favorite cartoon, and you see a character throw a ball. Your brain instantly guesses where and when the ball will land. This ability to understand and predict how things move and change over time and space is known as Spatial-Temporal Reasoning.

### In-depth explanation

In the world of Artificial Intelligence, Spatial-Temporal Reasoning refers to the capacity of an AI system to comprehend and predict the outcomes of certain events based on their spatial and temporal relationships. 

Spatial reasoning revolves around understanding the position, directions, transformations, and relationships of objects in space. It involves queries such as "Is object A to the right of object B?" or recognizing an object's transformed instance (e.g., an image of a car from a different perspective).

Temporal reasoning, on the other hand, deals with the aspect of time - ordering events, understanding durations, causalities, or predicting future occurrences based on past and present events.

Combining these two, Spatial-Temporal Reasoning is about comprehending the interplay of space and time. A simple example could be predicting the trajectory of a moving car based on its speed and direction.

Various techniques are used in AI for spatial-temporal reasoning, ranging from rule-based systems or logic programming (like STRIPS - STanford Research Institute Problem Solver), geometric models, probabilistic models (like Hidden Markov Models), to trainable deep learning models like RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory ), and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks.

It's noteworthy that spatial-temporal reasoning tasks often involve substantial complexity, as they require high-level understanding and synthesis of raw sensory data (like images and videos), which is a challenging area in AI research. Recent advances in deep learning are pushing the boundaries but achieving robust, generalizable spatial-temporal reasoning still remains a largely unsolved and active area of study.
