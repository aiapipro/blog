### Summary
Abductive Logic Programming is a computation and AI reasoning framework where conclusions are drawn through best explanations. It targets uncovering implicit facts by hypothesizing the most likely causes that could lead to observed data.

### ELI5
Think about how a detective solves a mystery. They find several clues, like a footprint, a hair, or a weird smell. Instead of assuming the criminal left all of them, which could lead them down the wrong path, they try different scenarios and choose the one that best connects all the clues. That's what Abductive Logic Programming does, but for computers solving AI problems.

### In-depth explanation
Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) is an extension of traditional logic programming and an integral part of artificial intelligence that deals with reasoning from effects to causes. Normal logic programming usually proceeds via forward or backward chaining of rules, but ALP takes a different route: it works by reasoning backwards, from consequences to their best explanations. 

In ALP, a system is given a set of facts and asked to explain them using a set of abducible predicates (pushing back to their origins). It aims at devising the most likely scenario that could lead to the given facts. Hyptheses or temporary assumptions are made for the unground abducibles, and system rules are applied backwards to verify if the assumptions stand. If the hypothesis does not conflict with the given system rules and facts, the assumption is accepted as a plausible explanation. 

Efficient use of ALP requires non-monotonic reasoning and often integrates the use of inductive logic programming to learn models. The abductive reasoning process is inherently uncertain as it is based on incomplete information, thus it's frequently combined with probabilistic frameworks such as Bayesian networks to handle uncertainty providing us with probabilistic abductive logic programming.

While deduction derives certain conclusions from a set of premises and induction infers general laws from particular instances, abduction, in contrast, introduces premises likely to be true. It is the process of inference to the best explanation. 

ALP has garnered attention due to its wide applicability in areas like natural language processing, generating explanations in expert systems, solving puzzles, detecting faults in systems, etc., in the AI domain.
