### Summary
"Translational Invariance" is a concept meaning that the detection of a feature in data is not affected by its location or position. In AI, this property is highly useful in image and signal processing, as the system can identify particular patterns regardless of where they appear in the data.

### ELI5
Let’s say you're playing "Where's Waldo?" With translational invariance, it doesn't matter where Waldo is hiding—top, bottom, left, or right, you can still recognize him. Similarly, in AI, this means a system can recognize a cat in a picture no matter where the cat is - top corner, bottom center, and so on.

### In-depth explanation
In machine learning, particularly in the context of computer vision, "translational invariance" is a crucial concept. This term refers to the ability of a model to identify or recognize a pattern irrespective of its position within the input data.

The best demonstration of translational invariance comes in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), employed significantly for image and video recognition tasks. Each convolutional layer in a CNN applies multiple filters across the entire image, scanning both vertically and horizontally. These filters, or kernels, serve to identify various features within the image. An individual filter might, for instance, detect horizontal lines, while another might focus on vertical lines.

By applying these filters across the entire image, CNNs ensure translational invariance. In other words, if a kernel has learned to recognize a particular feature (like the shape of a cat's ear), it will be able to detect that feature irrespective of the feature's spatial location in the image.

Translational invariance is an underpinning reason for the success of CNNs in image-based tasks. It allows these networks to comprehend complex patterns within images even when the position of these patterns change. However, it's important to note, that while providing robustness to the model, there are situations where translational invariance may be a limitation. For instance, in some tasks, the position of items relative to each other is critical, and information about their position could be crucial.
