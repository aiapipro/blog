### Summary

Partial Order Reduction is a technique used in model checking for reducing the state space by identifying portions that can be run in different orders without impacting the overall system's behavior.

### ELI5

Imagine you're trying to find a specific toy in a huge pile of toys. Instead of looking through every single one, you might group them by color or type to make your search quicker and more efficient. Partial Order Reduction works similarly in AI, where it helps skip certain steps in a process without missing any crucial information, thereby making computations more efficient.

### In-depth explanation
  
Partial Order Reduction (POR) aids in tackling state-explosion problems in model checking—an automatic method used to verify concurrent and distributed systems. Model checking checks all states of a system to verify if a property holds or not, which can result in an explosion of numerous states. POR helps tame this explosion by reducing redundant checks of sequences leading to the same state.

Technically, POR identifies commutative actions—actions that, regardless of their execution order, lead to equivalent states. This identification means only a fragment of all possible execution sequences, potentially smaller, needs to be examined. It leverages the fact that systems often contain multiple sequences of events leading to the same outcome. By eliminating redundancies, POR eases the computational burden, allowing more efficient verification of systems.

Yet, choosing which sequences can be omitted without losing essential information is nontrivial. It's done via ample set methods or stubborn set techniques, ensuring adequate representation of system properties and the correctness of reduction.

Keep in mind that while effective, POR isn't always sufficient in the wake of enormous state spaces, and other techniques may be needed complementary, such as symbolic representation or abstractions.
