### Summary
A Network Motif is a recurring, significant pattern of interconnections in a network. In AI, it's a fundamental building block in studying complex network structures, enhancing our understanding around connectivity in artificial neural networks.

### ELI5
Imagine you're working on a jigsaw puzzle. You will start to notice that certain pieces fit together often, making a common pattern. This pattern helps you solve the puzzle faster. In AI, a "Network Motif" is like that common pattern. It's a group of nodes and connections that show up a lot in a network, and this pattern helps us understand and model the network better.

### In-depth explanation
Network motifs are subgraphs or patterns in a larger network that recur at frequencies higher than those found in random networks. They are considered as the basic building blocks of network architecture and are prevalent in a variety of complex systems, from biological to technological and social networks.

In the context of AI and Machine Learning, the concept of network motifs is often used in the study of artificial neural networks (ANNs), deep learning models, and various other network-based methodologies. For instance, by identifying common network motifs in ANNs, researchers can gain insights into the 'black box', thereby improving the interpretability of these models.

The identification of network motifs involves looking for frequently recurring interconnection patterns that appear statistically significantly more than in randomized networks. These motifs can be as simple as a set of linear connections or might embody more complex interconnections, such as loops or parallel connections.

The significance of a motif is determined by comparing its frequency of occurrence in the network to its frequency of occurrence in randomized networks with the same size and degree sequences. If the frequency of a particular motif in the original network significantly deviates from the randomized models, it is considered a network motif.

By studying these motifs, it's possible to understand the typical types of computations that the neural network performs, allowing experts to better interpret the functioning of the network, improve its performance, and generalize this knowledge to design more efficient architectures in the future. Furthermore, motifs could serve towards compression strategies, reducing the complexity of large-scale ANNs without a significant loss of functionality.
