### Summary
Structured Data refers to information that is organized in a way that is easy for computers to understand. They are clearly formatted and have a high degree of organization, such as databases or spreadsheets, and thus easily searchable.

### ELI5
Imagine your toy box where you categorize your toys: cars go with cars, dolls with dolls, building blocks with building blocks. It’s easier to find what you need, right? That's how structured data works!

### In-depth explanation
In the context of AI and ML, Structured Data refers to any set of data that resides within a defined framework and follows a certain order. It’s typically characterized by its ability to be easily stored, accessed, and processed in a fixed format - this could be anything like a spreadsheet or relational database.

Think of structured data this way: a grocery list neatly arranged in columns - fruits in one column, vegetables in another, and so on. The predictability and fixed structure simplify the task of searching, sorting, and processing that list.

Where structured data really shines is when we need to perform queries and analysis. Structured Query Language (SQL) can be used to probe structured databases and derive insights. Structured data's highly organized format makes it highly amenable to machine learning algorithms.

Machine learning thrives on structured data. Supervised learning algorithms, for instance, use labeled structured data for training. Here, the structure provides clearly defined features (the input) and labels (the output). The decision tree algorithm, a popular ML algorithm, is particularly efficient on structured data. It constructs a model of decisions based on actual values of attributes in the data.

While structured data provides a lot of advantages, it worth mentioning that not all valuable information is structured. Unstructured data, which does not fit neatly into tables or relational databases, represents a large portion of data currently produced. Examples include text, images, audio, etc.
