### Summary

Frame language is a conceptual approach to understanding linguistic and cognitive structures through interpretive schemas, termed "frames". This paradigm has been utilized extensively within artificial intelligence, aiding in the comprehension of how human knowledge can be represented and processed within an AI system.

Imagine you are looking at a picture in a photo album. The photo is of a circus. You see clowns, elephants, and a big tent. Even though nobody told you it's a circus, you understand it because you know what things usually exist at a circus. A frame language works similarly in AI. It's like a mental picture that helps the AI understand certain situations, filled with details that usually exist there, making it easier for the AI to predict what's happening or what may happen next.

### In-depth explanation

In artificial intelligence, a frame is a data structure for representing a stereotyped situation, like "being in a certain kind of location" or "purchasing a particular type of item". A frame language is a type of language designed to express such frames. A frame can be thought of as a network of nodes and relations that together provide a way to understand a specific type of situation or concept.

The idea of frames was developed as a method of understanding how we, as humans, use context to interpret information. It recognizes that when we think of a particular concept or scenario, our minds instantly bring up a whole network of associated ideas and expectations. For instance, if one thinks of a "restaurant", several associated concepts like tables, chairs, menu, waiter, etc., immediately come to mind. The same logic is applied in an AI system through the use of frames. 

In AI, each node in a frame would represent an entity or concept, and the relations would define how these concepts interact or relate to each other. These can be specific facts, contexts, or even rules and guidelines for how the concept should be interpreted. Some nodes could represent fixed required elements of the situation or conceptual frame, while others could represent optional or variable elements. The representation of these relations may vary among different frame languages, as may the specific methods employed for handling default information, exceptions, or conflicts among the facts or rules associated with the frame.

The use of frame languages allows AI systems to better understand and represent the complexity and richness of human knowledge. They can be used in a range of applications, including natural language understanding and generation, expert systems, cognitive models, and many others. 

There are a variety of frame languages designed for different purposes. Some are used for general-purpose knowledge representation, while others are designed for specific tasks such as natural language processing or diagnostic reasoning. Some well-known frame languages include FrameNet, ConceptNet, and CycL.
