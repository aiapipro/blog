### Summary
Ethics of Artificial Intelligence is the area of study centered on the moral, legal, and societal effects of AI. Its concerns include fairness, transparency, accountability, and the prevention of harm.

### ELI5
Imagine you're playing a game of chess with a robot (AI). Should the robot always let you win because it’s programmed to make you happy, or should it play fairly, even if it means you might lose? This is a simple version of "ethics of AI"; it’s about deciding what is right or wrong for AI to do.

### In-depth explanation
The "Ethics of AI" is a comprehensive field that incorporates philosophical, legal, and societal considerations surrounding the use and influence of AI systems. It seeks to answer questions about how AI should be designed, developed, and implemented in a way that aligns with human values and societal conventions.

This field often looks at the principles of fairness, accountability, transparency, and harm prevention. Fairness pertains to avoiding bias and ensuring that AI systems treat all individuals and groups equitably. Accountability refers to determining who is responsible when an AI system causes damage or makes an error. Transparency advocates for the clarity in AI decision-making processes. Lastly, harm prevention emphasizes the importance of developing AI that doesn't cause harm to humans, whether physically or psychologically.

The "Ethics of AI" stands in intimate relation with other areas of study, like algorithmic fairness and bias, explainable AI, and privacy in machine learning. Algorithmic fairness and bias revolve around creating algorithms that do not perpetuate or enforce harmful patterns or prejudices. Explainable AI is about building AI models that can clearly explain their decisions and actions to human users. Privacy in machine learning concerns the use of data, ensuring that AI systems respect the personal information they are trained on.

Ethical considerations often affect the entire AI lifecycle - from data collection to disposal. At the data collection stage, concerns include the collection of sensitive or personal data and informed consent. During the training stage, issues center on algorithmic bias and fairness. For the deployment stage, concerns revolve around misuse of AI systems, transparency, and accountability. Even once an AI system is no longer in use, ethical considerations persist, especially regarding data archiving or deletion.

Rest assured, many AI researchers, ethicists, and policymakers are actively exploring these questions, working to shape guidelines and regulations that ensure the ethical use of AI in society.
