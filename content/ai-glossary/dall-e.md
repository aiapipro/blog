### Summary
DALL-E 2 (or 3) is an advanced version of the original DALL-E, a generative AI model developed by OpenAI. Its specialization lies in creating unique and high-quality images from text descriptions, demonstrating powerful capabilities in understanding and implementing complex visual concepts.

### ELI5
Imagine you have a magical art box. You just tell it what you want, like "a two-story pink house shaped like a shoe" or "a dancing pineapple playing guitar", and it would just sketch it out for you! DALL-E is like that super art box, but it's a computer program instead.

### In-depth explanation
Scientifically, DALL-E is a model based on the GPT-3 language model framework. Its core function is to generate creative images from textual descriptions.

DALL-E's functioning relies on a technique known as transformer networks, a type of model which processes data in parallel, unlike conventional sequential models. DALL-E uses this technique to transpose language understanding into visual representation.

In its first leg, similar to GPT-3, tokens, which are the smallest units of meaningful text, are processed by DALL-E. The model builds linguistic comprehension from these tokens. The second leg is where DALL-E primarily differs from GPT-3. It transposes text tokens into visual concepts by linking them to a pre-constructed image grid, which is a combination of multiple images. 

DALL-E's training process involves vast amounts of data, consisting of varied image-text pairs. This large data consumption enables the model to generate intricate and highly accurate visual representations. The more intriguing aspect of DALL-E is its ability to produce elements in images that might be impossible in the physical world â€“ such as "a cube of rainbow-colored water" or "a two-story house shaped like an egg". This aspect demonstrates the model's potent capability in handling abstract concepts at a complex level.
