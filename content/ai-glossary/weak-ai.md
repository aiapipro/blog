### Summary
Weak AI, also known as Narrow AI, refers to an artificial intelligence system designed to perform a specific task, such as voice recognition. These systems are not sentient and cannot understand, respond to, or learn from stimuli beyond their pre-defined capabilities.

### ELI5
Imagine if you train a dog to fetch a ball. You throw the ball and the dog runs, grabs it, and brings it back to you. This is the dog's specific task, and it can do it very well. But, if you ask the dog to play chess, it can't, because it wasn't trained for that. In a similar way, weak AI can do one specific task that it's been trained for, but it can't do anything else.

### In-depth explanation
In the field of artificial intelligence, Weak AI, also known as Narrow AI, refers to systems that are designed for a specific task and can only work within a limited context. These AI systems do not possess true intelligence or comprehension, but they may seem intelligent because they can mimic human behavior to a certain extent within their problem domain.

The development of Weak AI systems typically involves task-specific programming, machine learning techniques, and sometimes a combination of both. These AI systems can analyze and learn from data related to their specific tasks to improve over time, although this advancement is limited.

Examples of Weak AI include most of the AI that we see today like Siri, Alexa, chatbots, recommendation engines, etc. These are systems that have been developed to serve specific functions and cannot operate beyond their defined remit. Siri, for instance, can help iPhone users answer questions, send messages, or perform simple tasks, but it doesn't understand the tasks it performs. It follows predefined algorithms and learns from user interactions within the scope of its predefined capabilities.

Weak AI systems might appear "intelligent" in their specific area because they can process large amounts of data and make decisions based on this information, but they lack the understanding of the tasks they are performing. They work based on the instructions and the programming given to them and do not possess sentience. Essentially, while they can mimic human intelligence when performing their task, they do not posses understanding and self-awareness, unlike what is anticipated from the concept of Strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

The development and application of Weak AI offer significant opportunities for automation and efficiency. Considering their limitations, it is crucial to remember they are tools that mimic human intelligence in a narrow field rather than exhibiting true intelligence. This distinction is central to ethical considerations and the broader debate about the potential impact of AI on society.
