### Summary
Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary study of mind and intelligence, encompassing multiple fields including psychology, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy of mind, and education. In the context of AI, it seeks to understand and replicate human intelligence in machines by studying how humans think and learn.

### ELI5
Imagine we are trying to build a super smart robot that can think and learn like a human. But before we can do that, we first have to understand how our own brains work - how we learn new things, remember stuff or make decisions. Cognitive Science is like a detective trying to figure out these secrets of the human brain, but using different tools from other fields like psychology, neuroscience, computer science and more.

### In-depth explanation
Cognitive Science represents an intriguing cross-section of disciplines encompassing psychology, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, and education. It focuses on the study of human intelligence and cognition - essentially how we think, learn, remember, and solve problems. Its fundamental objective is to understand these cognitive processes and implement them into artificial systems, allowing development of AI that can "think" and adapt like humans.

One critical area of Cognitive Science is studying human problem-solving and decision-making processes. This research directly impacts the design of AI algorithms, specifically those focused on decision-making, such as decision trees or Bayesian networks. 

Neuroscience inputs, especially insights into how human brain processes information and executes decisions, facilitates the design of neural networks in AI. These networks mimic the human brain's structure and function, forming the basis of deep learning models.

Linguistics plays a significant role in Cognitive Science, particularly in developing natural language processing (NLP) models in AI. By understanding how humans naturally use language, cognitive scientists can improve machine understanding and generation of human language.

Philosophy and ethics are also key in Cognitive Science as they tackle moral and philosophical questions of AI. It supports establishing ethical standards and guidelines in AI development and application, essential for consensus in AI ethics discussions.

Understanding cognitive development and learning theories in humans helps develop AI capable of learning from experience - reinventing Machine Learning models to improve their learning strategies and efficiency.

Cognitive Science is dynamically evolving, incorporating advancements across multiple disciplines to continually refine our understanding of cognition and consequently improve AI's cognitive abilities.
