### Summary
The Bees Algorithm is a population-based search algorithm inspired by the food foraging behavior of honey bees. It is particularly effective when dealing with multi-modal optimization problems, helping to find global and local minima/maxima in complex landscapes.

### ELI5
Imagine honey bees searching for food. Some bees scout for flowers, then return to the hive and do a 'waggle dance' to share the location of good food sources. Other bees follow these directions to the food. Over time, more and more bees go to the best food sources, while fewer go to less rewarding ones. In this way, the bees collectively find the best flowers. The Bees Algorithm is like this, but it helps computers find the best solutions to complex problems.

### In-depth explanation
The Bees Algorithm is a nature-inspired algorithm used in global optimization problems. It's derived from the foraging behavior of honey bees, particularly their methodology of propagating information about food sources to the other bees in the colony. This mimics the exploration-exploitation trade-off being performed by a swarm of bees, thus, is categorized under swarm intelligence.

This algorithm works by first creating a population of agents, analogous to bees, with their positions in the problem space representing potential solutions. The algorithm iteratively modifies these positions, or solutions, with an objective to maximize or minimize a certain fitness function.

Agents in the Bees Algorithm are classified into two types: employed foragers (local search bees) and unemployed foragers. The unemployed foragers consist of onlookers, waiting in the hive, and scouts. Employed foragers are associated with a specific food source and are responsible for exploiting that. They perform local random searches within the proximity of their food source, following a 'waggle dance' if the new position found is better than the initial food source.

Unemployed foragers, on the other hand, have no specific food source. Onlookers watch the 'waggle dance' of employed foragers and choose new sources proportionally to their quality. Scouts perform random searches throughout the entire field, aiming to explore new areas and prevent premature convergence to local optima.

The algorithm performs an iterative sequence of these processes: scouting, site abandonment, recruitment of foragers, and local search. The final result is the identification of the best solutions found during the search, typically represented as a list of best positions and associated fitness scores.

The strength of the Bees Algorithm lies in its balance of local search and global search, leading to robust performance in multimodal optimization problems, and making it particularly suitable for applications such as neural network training, image analysis, and function optimization.
