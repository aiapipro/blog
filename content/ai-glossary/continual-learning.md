### Summary
Continual Learning, also known as Lifelong Learning, refers to the ability of an AI model to continuously learn from streams of data, retaining the knowledge from past tasks while learning new tasks, without suffering catastrophic forgetting.

### ELI5
Imagine you're a chef who often learns new recipes. Every new recipe doesn't make you forget the old ones, right? Actually, sometimes learning new recipes might even improve your skills in making old ones. That's like continual learning in AI. It's the ability to learn new things while remembering the old and constantly improving overall.

### In-depth explanation
Continual Learning is a subfield of machine learning where the model is trained to learn multiple tasks in sequence. It primarily focuses on developing, testing, and implementing algorithms and methods that allow an AI or machine learning model to learn from new data continuously over time, incorporating the new knowledge into the existing model while maintaining what it has already learned. 

The most significant challenge in continual learning is "catastrophic forgetting" or "interference," where the AI system forgets the established knowledge when new information is introduced. Continual Learning strategies make an effort to overcome this challenge and ensure significant information retention from past learned tasks and knowledge.

There are several approaches to manage catastrophic forgetting:

- **Regularization methods**: These methods reduce changes to the parameters involved in earlier tasks when learning a new task. For instance, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) is one such commonly used method.

- **Dynamic architectures**: Here, the model architecture is expanded to allow it to learn and accommodate new information without overwriting past knowledge.

- **Memory replay/rehearsal methods**: Models are trained with a mixture of new data and past data (kept in a memory buffer) to mitigate the chances of forgetting.

The concept of Continual Learning resonates with the way humans or animals learn. It's an area of active research in AI as it's believed that developing robust Continual Learning solutions would make AI systems more adaptable and intelligent to ever-changing data and tasks over time.
