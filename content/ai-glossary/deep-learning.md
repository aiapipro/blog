### Summary
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to model and understand complex patterns in datasets. It's the engine behind image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing and many other technologies.

### ELI5
Imagine you're trying to recognize shapes. You start by learning simple ones (lines, circles, squares), which are like the basic lessons. As you learn more, you can recognize complex shapes like animals or vehicles. That's what deep learning does. It starts from simple features in data and builds upon them to understand complex patterns.

### In-depth explanation
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, which in turn is a branch of artificial intelligence. It is primarily concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain termed artificial neural networks. 

Deep learning aims to teach machines what comes naturally to human beings: to learn from experience. It does this by using a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural network (ANN). The design of an ANN is inspired by the biological network of neurons in the neural structure of the human brain, leading to the technique's classification as a subset of machine learning.

Each layer of neurons enables the model to ‘learn’ different features of the input data. For instance, in image processing, a deep learning model might learn to identify edges from raw pixels in the first layer, then use the edges to learn more complex shapes in the second layer, and so on until it’s able to identify the image.

The 'depth' in deep learning isn't an understood quantity; rather, it refers to the number of layers in a neural network – the presumption is 'the more layers, the deeper the model'. Hence the term deep learning. Progressively, initial layers may learn very simple features, while subsequent layers transform them into more abstract features.

Deep learning plays a pivotal role in many domains. For instance, it's instrumental in enabling autonomous vehicles to recognize a stop sign and distinguishing a pedestrian from a lamppost. It’s also well-suited to recognizing patterns, which can be very useful in forecasting business trends, predicting the stock market, and personalizing marketing efforts.

The boon and bane of deep learning is the large amount of data it requires. While large amounts of data can improve performance, it also means deep learning models can be very complicating, requiring significant amounts of computation power.

Deep learning is revolutionizing many industries, by being at the forefront of cutting-edge technologies, like autonomously driving cars, smart assistants, facial recognition systems, and disease forecasting systems.
