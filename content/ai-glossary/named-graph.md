### Summary
A Named Graph is a foundational structure in semantic web technologies allowing individual RDF graphs to be identified distinctly. It aids in handling larger datasets and forms a basis for implementing metadata at the graph level for RDF data.

### ELI5
Imagine a classroom of students, where each student is unique and has a name. Now, each student also possesses a bag full of different things. Here, each student is like a "Named Graph," and the items in their bags are the data associated with them. This way, each youngster, or "Named Graph," stands unique with its distinctive data.

### In-depth explanation
In the context of web semantics and AI, a Named Graph, often used in RDF (Resource Description Framework) data model, is a set of triples that are grouped together and associated with a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). 

A Named Graph essentially provides a context to the graph, making it a crucial tool for managing complex RDF data. In RDF, information is represented as triples (Subject-Predicate-Object) and sometimes, these triples need to be separated or segmented. This is where Named Graphs come into view.

Named Graphs add an extra layer of information by providing a context or 'name' to a set of triples, thereby permitting the separation of different sets of triples within the same dataset. This facilitates higher-level operations like graph comparison, grouping, and other operations that might be required in complex AI tasks. 

An RDF triple, within the Named Graph context, becomes a quadrupleâ€”consisting of the graph's URI and the original triple. These quadruples serve as an essential base for many semantic technologies.

Named Graphs also enable attaching metadata at a graph level. This metadata could include information such as who created the graph, when was it created, what its source is, and more, thereby providing valuable context about the graph. 

Ample work around Named Graphs includes entailment, usage in SPARQL queries, and assigning trust values to different graphs. The potential that Named Graphs hold is well recognized, and they're widely used in semantic data processing engines and AI algorithms interacting with RDF data.
