### Summary
A Loss Aggregator is a component that computes an aggregated measure of model predictions' errors. It condenses individual prediction mistakes into a single representative value, guiding the model's learning to make better predictions.

### ELI5
Imagine you're playing a game of darts. Each time you throw a dart, you might not hit the exact centre of the board. These misses are like a model's prediction errors. Now, if we wanted to improve our aim, we'd need to understand how off target we are on average. A Loss Aggregator acts as a helper doing that job. It gathers all our misses and gives us one number that represents how well or poorly we are doing. This helps us know if we're getting better or worse at the game.

### In-depth explanation
A Loss Aggregator is integral to the training process of Machine Learning (ML) models. Simply put, the Loss Aggregator calculates the total or average error a model produces when predicting the output or class of given data.

For example, consider we have a model trained to predict house prices given certain features such as house size, location, and age. With each prediction made by the model, an associated error can be computed based on how much the model's prediction deviates from the actual price. These individual errors are then aggregated, generally through summation or averaging, to give an overall loss value. 

The aggregated loss value is critical as it provides a quantitative benchmark of the model's performance and plays a role in adjusting the model's internal parameters in order to reduce predictive error – a process known as optimization.

Loss Aggregators are often used in conjunction with a Loss Function, which defines how individual errors for each prediction are calculated. Different loss functions may be used depending on the type of ML problem — for instance, Mean Squared Error (MSE) is often used in regression problems, while Cross-Entropy Loss is typical for classification problems.

Crucially, the choice of a Loss Aggregator depends on the type of problem and specific requirements. For instance, in case of highly skewed data, one might opt for median instead of mean as an aggregator in order to better deal with outliers. Further complexities can be handled by deploying weighted averages as opposed to simple averages, giving more importance to certain types of errors. Aggregators can be designed to be more sensitive to either false positives or false negatives, depending on the specific requirements of a given problem.
