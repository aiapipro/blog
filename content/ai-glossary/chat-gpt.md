### Summary
ChatGPT is an AI-powered model developed by OpenAI that generates human-like text. It's main use case is carrying out conversations with users, responding intelligibly to a wide variety of prompts.

### ELI5
Imagine having a friend who is a very good storyteller and can keep a conversation going on any topic you think of. That's what ChatGPT does, but it's a computer program, not a person.

### In-depth explanation
ChatGPT is a powerful text generation model developed by OpenAI. The "GPT" part stands for "Generative Pretrained Transformer", which reflects its underlying machine learning architecture.

Developed on the principles of transformer architecture, which is the basis of recent advances in natural language processing, ChatGPT processes input data through self-attention and produces output that has context derived from all the input data points.

Uses large-scale transformer models like GPT-3 to provide context-based predictions of the subsequent word in a sequence. The details of our conversation, like previous dialogues and responses given, form the context for the next response it generates.

ChatGPT has been fine-tuned for conversational interactions using a technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Earlier versions of the model are supervised by humans in a conversation, where they play both the roles of the user and the AI, which gives ChatGPT responses to learn from. Later on, the model's responses are ranked by quality also using human judgment, and this ranking is used to further improve the model through reinforcement learning.

Fine-tuning makes the model useful for many real-world applications, it can write emails, generate code, provide tutoring, translate languages, and simulate characters for video games among many other things.

However, it's not perfect and makes several types of mistakes. It can sometimes generate inappropriate or biased content, make factual errors, or be excessively verbose. It might respond to harmful instructions or exhibit poor behavior if not handled with care.

OpenAI deploys substantial safety mitigations to handle these issues, like making the fine-tuning process more understandable and controllable, and building AI to AI moderation systems to proactively block unsafe content.
