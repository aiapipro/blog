### Summary
Adaptability, in artificial intelligence, is the ability of an AI system to learn from and respond effectively to changes in the environment it operates in. The term emphasizes systems that not only learn from historic data but also adapt dynamically to new data or situations.

### ELI5
Imagine you're learning to ride a bike. At first, you wobble a lot and might even fall. But with practice, your brain learns to adapt your balance to how the bike moves. Over time, you become proficient, riding smoothly even on bumpy roads or windy days. Adaptability in AI is similar - an AI system learns and adjusts its behavior when new or unexpected situations come up.

### In-depth explanation
In the field of artificial intelligence, adaptability is a key aspect of learning algorithms that allows them to adjust to changes and novelties in their environment. This indicates the AI system's ability to modify its own functioning based on the variations in the data it's processing or based on feedback from the environment.

The purpose of adaptability is to make AI and machine learning systems more robust and capable of handling real-world situations. In reality, data is not static but changes with time, and events can be highly unpredictable. Hence, a model that performs very well with a given dataset may not perform as well with a new set of data. Adaptability is what allows models to update and optimize themselves in the face of such changes.

The two main forms of learning that enable adaptability are Online Learning and Reinforcement Learning. In Online Learning, the learning algorithm updates itself continuously as new data points come in, rather than training on a static dataset. This kind of system can react promptly to changes in the input data distribution.

In Reinforcement Learning, the AI system interacts with its environment, receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusts its behavior to maximize the rewards. This kind of system can learn from its mistakes and improve its responses to new situations over time.

However, adaptability poses some challenges too. For instance, elements of unpredictability might be introduced, causing the algorithm to adjust in a way that's hard to foresee or interpret. Also, it may make it difficult to validate and test the system as traditional methods may not apply.

Understanding and enhancing the adaptability of AI systems is a critical research area in the field of AI, aiming towards creating systems that can operate effectively even in unpredictable and changing environments.
