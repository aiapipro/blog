### Summary
Behavior Informatics (BI) is a branch of artificial intelligence that aims to understand, predict, and improve human behavior through quantitative modelling. It focuses on patterns, structures, and relationships in behavioral data for the sake of insights and applied solutions.

### ELI5
Imagine you're watching a bunch of ants. You look at what the ants do, where they go, what they carry, and how they interact with each other. Then, you use this information to guess what they might do next, or to help them do their tasks better. That's what Behavior Informatics does, but instead of ants, it watches human actions and interactions.

### In-depth explanation
Behavior Informatics (BI) is a versatile and expansive domain at the intersection of artificial intelligence, data analytics, and behavioral sciences. It uses data-centric approaches to comprehend, predict, and optimize human behavior.

One of the central pursuits of BI is to capture, analyze, and interpret behavioral data, which comprises any data indicative of human actions or states. This data can emerge from various sources, like social media activity, physiological sensors, GPS tracking, or online customer interactions. The goal here is to reveal embedded patterns and structures within the behavior, to generate meaningful insights into human conduct.

Moreover, BI is heavily reliant on pattern recognition and predictive modelling, often facilitated by machine learning. The detection of patterns within a dataset helps BI applications to recognize and understand existing behaviors, while predictive modeling can anticipate future behaviors based on patterns from past data.

A key part of BI is its applicability; the insights derived from BI can be employed to improve the outcomes of actions and interventions. For instance, a company might use BI to enhance customer engagement by predicting which products a customer would most likely be interested in, based on historical purchasing data.

Finally, BI’s use isn’t confined to human behavior. The analytical techniques and models of behavior informatics can also be applied to artificial agents, including robots and AI systems, to improve their effectiveness or to make them act more like humans.
