### Summary
Robustness in AI refers to the ability of an algorithm to deliver accurate and consistent outcomes, even when the conditions deviate from those it was trained on. These conditions can include changes in the input data, alteration in the learning parameters, or introduction of noise.

### ELI5
Imagine you're playing a game where you have to identify animals. You've practiced a lot on your animal flashcards at home and you're really good at it. But one day, your friend brings different cards which are a little faded, and some of them are animals you've never seen before. If you can still play the game well, smoothly dealing with these new conditions, that's like having good robustness. It's like being a really flexible player who can handle surprises.

### In-depth explanation
In the context of AI and machine learning, robustness denotes the performance consistency of an algorithm when faced with unforeseen conditions that it was not originally trained on. This is a technical measure of how a model adapts and maintains accuracy whenever there are variations in the input data, system setting, operations, or environments.

Machine learning models are generally trained on a specific set of data in a controlled environment. During this training phase, the model learns from the examples provided and builds an understanding, which it uses to make predictions or take decisions. However, in the real world, data may have unexpected features, or the environment may change in ways not reflected in the training data. 

A highly robust algorithm will effectively handle these potential discrepancies. For instance, it might mitigate the effects of outliers, return reliable results even if the scale or distribution of the data changes, or perform correctly in the presence of noise or incomplete data. This quality of an AI system becomes especially important when dealing with complex or critical tasks such as in healthcare, autonomous vehicles, or financial decision making where the cost of an incorrect prediction could be high.

Achieving robustness usually comes down to well-planned validation strategies and continuous evaluation of the model on newer data and in varying contexts. This not only helps in ensuring the technical efficiency of the model but also contributes in making the system trustworthy and reliable.

However, robustness often presents a dichotomy with interpretability. As models become more complex to achieve robustness, they often sacrifice interpretability, making it difficult to explicitly understand why the model is making specific decisions. 

Practitioners need to balance this trade-off to achieve a model that is both robust against changes in the environment and interpretable to the end user. Additionally, understanding and monitoring the ethical implications of low robustness in AI models, such as unfair bias and discrimination, is an important aspect within the AI ethics field.
