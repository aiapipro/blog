### Summary
A constructed language is a language specifically contrived for communication between humans or between AI and humans, rather than naturally developed. In AI, it often refers to languages or data representations designed to formalize thought processes or communication protocols.

### ELI5
Imagine if you and your friends created your own secret language to talk. That's a constructed language! In AI, this could be like a special language which machines use to understand and express things better.

### In-depth explanation
A constructed language - also known as conlang - isn't solely AI-specific but plays a vital role in AI. It is a language deliberately created from scratch. It differs from natural languages like English or Spanish, which developed naturally over time amongst a group of people and has inconsistencies and irregular grammar. Constructed languages, on the other hand, are systematically designed with an intent. 

Constructed languages have been used for various purposes, such as auxiliary purposes, artistic expression (like Tolkien's Elvish), and experimental settings. Their applications skyrocketed with the advent of computer science. They can bring several advantages - from better understanding semantics and impacting the developer's thought process to controlling the level of ambiguity, and defining the AI's processing logic.

In the realm of AI and machine learning, constructed languages aim to formalize the communication system or data representation for the AI. They define a grammar and a vocabulary, which an AI uses to understand or represent its thoughts. Constructed languages in AI can be as simple as a markup language that holds metadata about a specific process, or it could be as complex as a conversational AI's understanding and generation tactic, leveraging natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) systems.

For example, the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is a kind of constructed language used in automated planning and scheduling. It was designed to express planning problems in a standardized, domain-independent manner.

Many AI communication interfaces or chatbots could also be perceived as leveraging a level of constructed language. They operate in a restricted set of vocabulary and grammar rules, with certain sentence structures yielding expected responses. These responses and their connection to various intents and actions form a constructed language that an AI system can comprehend more effectively than irregular natural language.

Constructed languages, with their clear rules and unambiguous grammars, support the logic-based AI approaches, although the connection isn't as direct in the deep learning methodologies that attempt to learn directly from unrefined, natural language data.
