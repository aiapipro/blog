### Summary
Automation in AI refers to the process of making systems or workflows operate independently with minimal or no human intervention. It leverages AI algorithms to learn tasks and make decisions, increasing efficiency and eliminating human error.

### ELI5
Imagine you have a toy robot that you program to clean up your toys. Once programmed, it does the cleaning on its own without you needing to tell it what to do each time. That's like automation - it's how we tell machines to do tasks by themselves.

### In-depth explanation
Automation, within the context of artificial intelligence, refers to delegating tasks ordinarily done by humans to AI systems. Typically achieved using machine learning algorithms, automation can handle both simple tasks, like data entry, and complex ones, like driving a car.

Three main components underline the process of automation in AI. 

1) Task Definition: This involves defining the specific tasks that the AI system will automate. It includes setting the objectives and restrictions for each task.

2) Model Training: The AI system is made aware of the tasks by being trained on a dataset relevant to that task. For instance, a predictive model might be trained on historical sales data to forecast future sales.

3) Application: Once the AI model is trained, it can be deployed to automate the task. The model can process new data, make decisions, and even adapt itself based on the results it produces.

Machine learning, a branch of AI, plays a crucial role in automation. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are methodologies that allow an AI system to learn from data, adjust its operations, and make decisions, enabling automation. Moreover, deep learning, a subset of machine learning that simulates the human brain's workings, allows an AI system to process vast amounts of data and automate complicated tasks.

AI-based automation is enhancing numerous sectors, from manufacturing to service industries. In Customer Relationship Management (CRM), instead of manually entering data, AI can collect and analyze customer interactions swiftly and efficiently. In healthcare, AI can predict patient outcomes and suggest treatment plans, reducing the burden on healthcare providers. In autonomous vehicles, AI controls the driving, maneuvering the vehicle without human intervention.

However, automation also raises ethical and societal questions. While automation through AI can increase efficiency and reduce labor costs, it may also lead to job displacement. Furthermore, the issue of decision-making transparency and bias in AI models remains a concern. Developers need to implement ethical AI practices to mitigate these issues, ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability.
