### Summary
The Chinese Room is a philosophical argument designed to challenge the view that computers or machines can possess understanding or consciousness simply by processing inputs and delivering outputs. It suggests there is more to understanding and consciousness than just the ability to respond appropriately to prompts.

### ELI5
Imagine you’re in a room with boxes full of Chinese symbols. Somebody hands you a note with Chinese characters through a slot. You can’t read Chinese but have a very detailed instruction book, which tells you what symbols to send back based on the note you received. Even though you can't understand Chinese, from the outside, it seems like you do because you're sending back the right responses. This is the "Chinese Room" argument. It means just because a computer can give the correct responses, doesn't mean it really understands what it's doing.

### In-depth explanation
The Chinese Room argument was proposed by philosopher John Searle in 1980 as a critique of strong artificial intelligence, which holds that a computer running a program could possess the same kind of consciousness and understanding as a human mind. 

In this thought experiment, Searle invites us to imagine a room containing a person who doesn't understand Chinese. The room is designed such that it can be given input in the form of Chinese characters and will output other Chinese characters. The input and output are based on a very detailed "program", or recipe book, present in the room, which the person inside follows without comprehension. The crux of the argument is that the room's ability to accept and respond to the Chinese characters does not entail understanding by the person inside the room.

The person in the room is, in this analogy, similar to a computer following a program; they are able to respond correctly to inputs by following a set of rules, but do not possess any understanding of the meaning behind their actions. In other words, while the person inside the room might be able to give the appearance of understanding Chinese, they don't really understand it in any meaningful sense.

This argument is an answer to the Turing Test, which suggests that if a machine can convince a human that it is a human too, then it can be said to 'think'. The Chinese Room argument opposes this view by distinguishing between syntactic processing (manipulation of symbols) and semantic understanding (understanding of meaning).

This argument has provoked diverse responses within the field of AI research and philosophy and it continues to be one of the active debates in AI ethics and philosophy.
