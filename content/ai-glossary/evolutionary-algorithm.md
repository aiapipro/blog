### Summary
An Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is an AI optimization technique inspired by natural evolution processes. It solves problems by iteratively generating and selecting candidate solutions based on their 'fitness', akin to natural selection survival of the fittest.

### ELI5
Imagine you're trying to build the perfect sandcastle, but you're not sure how. So instead of guessing, you build a bunch of them. Some are tall, some wide, others have cool towers. You then choose the best ones, copy them, tweak a bit, and make more castles. Over time, you'll end up with really good sandcastles that are molded through this trial and error process. That's what evolutionary algorithms do but with problem-solving!

### In-depth explanation
An Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is a subset of evolutionary computation, which involves computational models inspired by evolutionary processes for solving complex optimization or search problems. It borrows principles from biological evolution such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to an optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions.

An EA operates through a cycle of four main stages. 

1. **Initial Population**: The algorithm starts with a pool of randomly generated individuals. Each individual (candidate solution) is represented in a way that can be tested for fitness against the problem to be solved.

2. **Selection**: Individuals are probabilistically selected based on fitness. The better solutions have higher chance, simulating survival of the fittest. This is often executed through mechanisms like roulette wheel selection, rank selection, or tournament selection.

3. **Variation**: The selected individuals undergo variation to produce new candidate solutions. This can be through **recombination** or crossover, where bits of information from two or more parents are combined, or through **mutation**, where small, random changes are made in some individuals.

4. **Replacement**: The original population is replaced by the new one, completing the generational cycle. Replacement could involve replacing all individuals or only the least fit ones.

This cycle repeats until a satisfactory solution is found or a termination condition is met (like maximum iterations). 

EAs can be adapted for different problems by changing the representation of individuals and the definition of fitness, allowing a very general approach modifiable for specific use cases.

One of the main advantages of EAs is their ability to search large, complex spaces where traditional methods may not be effective. However, they usually require more computational resources, and finding the right balance in their parameters (mutation rate, population size) can be a challenge.
