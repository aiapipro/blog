### Summary
An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings. It self-encodes the data representation by learning to copy its input to its output, compressing and reconstructing the input in the process.

### ELI5
Imagine you have a big, messy toy box and you want to organize it. But there's a twist: you want to organize it in such a way that you can find your toys using as few words as possible. You could do this by creating a special language that can describe a toy using fewer words. This is what an autoencoder does: it learns how to describe data in a simpler (compressed) way, and then uses those descriptions to recreate the original data.

### In-depth explanation
An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network that self-encodes its own structure. It consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes the input, applies a transformation, and produces a condensed version of the input, often of lower dimensionality, known as the encoded representation or code. After this compression, the decoder attempts to reconstruct the original input from the encoded representation.

The primary goal of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction or anomaly detection. Training an autoencoder involves the use of a specific type of machine learning algorithm called unsupervised learning which does not require labeled data.

The learning process is done by minimizing a loss function, often referred to as reconstruction error, which measures the difference between the original input and its reconstructed output. This process allows the autoencoder to learn how to effectively represent the underlying structure of the data.

Autoencoders are fundamentally data-specific, which means they will only be able to compress data similar to what they have been trained on. For instance, an autoencoder trained on pictures of faces would do a rather poor job of compressing pictures of trees, because the features it would learn would be face-specific.

There are different variants of autoencoders, including but not limited to: linear autoencoders, denoising autoencoders, sparse autoencoders, and variational autoencoders. Each variant introduces a different concept or mechanism that affects how the autoencoder learns to represent and reconstruct the data.
