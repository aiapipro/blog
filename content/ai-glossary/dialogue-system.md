### Summary
A dialogue system is a computer system designed to converse with humans in a natural way, usually by text but potentially also through speech. These systems are integral in creating interactive experiences for users in a multitude of applications such as virtual assistants, customer service bots, and more.

### ELI5
Imagine you have a toy robot and you ask it questions or give it commands, and it responds back just like a real person would. That's what a dialogue system is. It's like teaching the robot how to talk and respond in ways that make sense to us.

### In-depth explanation
Dialogue systems, sometimes called conversational agents, are a type of artificial intelligence designed to engage users in conversation. These systems have two main goals: understanding what people are saying (or writing) and responding in a way that makes sense. 

Understanding input often involves natural language processing (NLP), a subfield of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and humans through language. NLP tasks involved include speech recognition, syntactic analysis and semantic analysis. The system takes the input, recognizes the words or sentences, understands the grammar, identifies the main ideas and determines the context. 

Responding appropriately involves natural language generation, another aspect of NLP. Responses are generated based on the user's input and possibly on other contextual data or past dialogue. 

There are two main models of dialogue systems: rule-based and machine learning-based. Rule-based systems use a set of predetermined rules for conversation. In contrast, machine learning-based dialogue systems learn from data. Rule-based or template-driven dialogue systems are often easier to implement and control, but they can be rigid and lack the flexibility that a data-driven approach can provide.

Machine learning-based dialogue systems can be further divided into retrieval-based and generative models. Retrieval-based models have a repository of predefined responses and function by picking the best fit for a given input. Generative models, on the other hand, generate new responses from scratch. 

In terms of dialogue management, there are also two broad categories: those that use explicit state tracking and models that omit this stage. State tracking involves maintaining a record of the ongoing conversation, the user’s goals, and the system’s goals. Models that omit the state tracking stage, such as end-to-end systems, take user input and system actions as input, and directly generate the next system action.

Many dialogue systems today combine aspects of all these types to increase robustness, capability and user satisfaction. They can be found in a wide range of applications, such as virtual personal assistants like Siri or Alexa, customer service chatbots, or more specialized applications such as therapy bots or tutoring systems.
