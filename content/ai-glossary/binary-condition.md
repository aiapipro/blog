### Summary
A binary condition in AI refers to a situation where a decision or an output is based on two possible alternatives or states. It is fundamental to binary classification, decision trees, and boolean logic operations, which form the bedrock of many AI/ML models.

### ELI5
Imagine we're playing a game of "Guess the Animal", and all you can ask is yes or no questions. "Does it have feathers?" or "Does it live in the water?". Each question narrows down the options till you guess correctly. That's what a binary condition doesâ€”asks a yes-or-no question till we reach a decision.

### In-depth explanation
In machine learning and AI, a binary condition often refers to decision-making processes where the outcome can be one of two possibilities. These possibilities are typically represented as true/false, yes/no, or 1/0. Machine learning models often use binary conditions to split the data, predict an output, or make decisions.  

One common use of binary conditions is in binary classification, where an AI model predicts which of two classes an instance of data belongs to. Binary classification algorithms often involve learning method that uses binary conditions to make predictions, such as logistic regression or support vector machines.

In decision tree models, binary conditions are used at each node to partition the data. The binary condition represents a decision boundary in the feature space, splitting the data into two subsets, each of which is then processed in the subsequent nodes.

In boolean logic operations, which are fundamental to computer science and AI, binary conditions represent the state of a bit: 1 for true/on and 0 for false/off. These states are used to conduct logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, which are fundamental for computer arithmetic operations, and in turn, any kind of data processing.

In reinforcement learning, a binary condition might represent the end of a game or a task. If the agent's state meets the binary condition, it is either rewarded or the game ends. This is a common way to provide feedback and guide learning in reinforcement models.

Understanding binary conditions also makes thresholding clearer: at what point should a probability prediction be considered positive (true) or negative (false)? Decision making in AI doesn't always rely on binary conditions, and when it does the choice of condition has significant impacts on the model performance, interpretability and fairness.
