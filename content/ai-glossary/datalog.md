### Summary
Datalog is a declarative programming language designed for deductive database systems. It enables querying and forming logical expressions on multiple databases. Its simplicity and expressiveness make it a commonly used tool for reasoning over data. 

### ELI5
Datalog is like a translator that helps us ask questions (or queries) to a really big book of information (or database). Instead of needing to read through all the pages, Datalog makes it so we can simply ask the translator (Datalog) our question and it quickly gives us the answer by scanning all the information and figuring it out for us.

### In-depth explanation
Datalog originated in the late 1970s as a subset of the logic programming language Prolog. However, unlike Prolog, Datalog is side-effect free and its semantics are exactly defined which makes it easily optimizable for database systems.

The key use of Datalog is the querying and managing of deductive databases, but it also serves a broader role in AI for representing knowledge and reasoning because of its foundation in formal logic. Datalog programs are a set of rules with a head and a body separated by ":-", where the head is derived if the body holds true. Datalog is recursive, meaning rules can refer to themselves directly or indirectly, enabling complex recursive computations with crisp semantics. Datalog's strength is in its capability to express recursive queries succinctly where SQL, a more common database query language, struggles or often fails outright.

In Datalog, a fact is a basic proposition that cannot be reduced further. It's traditionally stored in databases as a table row. On the other hand, a rule is a statement that represents the relationship between facts. When a query is fired, Datalog automatically searches for facts and rules that can produce the desired result. This process is recursively repeated until it finds the answer or until all possibilities have been exhausted.

Though Datalog may not provide the procedural and object-oriented paradigms essential for general-purpose programming, it excels in tasks that involve data manipulation and complex querying. Its ability to decipher recursive queries with high efficiency makes it an excellent tool for artificial intelligence applications, particularly in knowledge representation and inductive logic programming -- a subfield of machine learning.
