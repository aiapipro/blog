### Summary
Controllability in AI refers to the ability to dictate the behavior of an AI system according to desired specifications. It determines to what extent the AI's responses can be manipulated or guided based on human-defined inputs and rules.

### ELI5
Imagine you're playing a video game, and you're controlling a character. You want the character to move right, to jump, or to pick up an object. In this scenario, you're in control! Controllability in AI is like that, but instead of a video game, it's software or a machine. It's all about making the AI do what you want it to do.

### In-depth explanation
Within the domain of artificial intelligence, controllability is an essential concept that revolves around the capacity to guide and manage the behavior of an AI model. The idea is to be able to define the rules, constraints, and actions that an AI or ML model should follow when executing its tasks, making decisions, or processing data.

Controllability is closely linked to the architectural design of AI models and their underlying algorithms. At a higher level, it's about setting up the system in a way that allows practitioners to influence its behavior. Practically, this includes methods like hyperparameter tuning, where model parameters can be manually adjusted to influence the model's learning process. It can also refer to the provision of specific instructions to a model in a task-oriented scenario.

In reinforcement learning, for instance, controllability further extends to apply and adjust rewards and penalties to guide the learning entity in its decisions-making process.  

However, full controllability can often be challenging to achieve due to the intrinsic complexity of AI models, especially as they grow in size and sophistication. Addressing controllability issues often demands a good understanding of the model's function, its decision-making process, and possible biases in the data it was trained on.

Controllability, therefore, is a balancing act between flexibility, performance, and predictability of an AI system. Adequate controllability ensures the system behaves as desired, but too much control can lead to overly complex systems and reduced system autonomy, thereby limiting its learning and adaptability capacity.
