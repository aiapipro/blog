### Summary
Bayesian Programming is a statistical approach in AI that helps in making probabilistic predictions. It utilizes prior knowledge and observed data for prediction, enabling the model to improve as more data becomes available.

### ELI5
Imagine you're playing a guessing game. Initially, you make guesses based on what you know so far, but as the game progresses, your guesses get better because you learn from your past guesses and the outcomes. Bayesian Programming works similarly: it makes educated guesses and learns from received data to make more accurate predictions next time.

### In-depth explanation
Bayesian programming, a subset of probability theory, is based on Bayes' Theorem. Its principle revolves around updating and revising predictions or hypotheses based on new incoming data or evidence, leveraging prior probabilities and observed data.

In a Bayesian model, initial beliefs are encapsulated as prior probabilities. As new data becomes available, these priors are updated using the Bayes' theorem to yield posterior probabilities, which are probabilities considering your new evidence. 

It's a depth-first search approach, where all possibilities are weighted for their probabilities and are updated as we receive more information. It incorporates a degree of uncertainty by working with probability distributions rather than point estimates.

In terms of programming, Bayesian Programming involves designing and implementing models, algorithms, or systems that use Bayesian methods for decision making. These programs often use Bayesian Networks, a type of probabilistic graphical model that represents the set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph.

In artificial intelligence and machine learning, Bayesian programming is essential for various applications. It is used in Bayesian classification for categorization tasks, Bayesian inference for decision-making processes, and reinforcement learning for sequentially improving complex systems.

Fundamentally, Bayesian programming allows models to learn and improve their predictions under uncertainty, thus being extensively used in machine learning algorithms where predicting under uncertainty is the main goal. It is also worth noting that Bayesian methods, paired with computational techniques, can manage and analyze complex and large data, making them exceptionally useful in the current data-driven era.
