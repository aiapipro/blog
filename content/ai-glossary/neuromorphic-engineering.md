### Summary
Neuromorphic engineering is an interdisciplinary field that borrows aspects of neuroscience, electronics, and computer science to design artificially intelligent systems that mimic the neural structure and adaptability of the human brain.

### ELI5
Imagine you're playing with your blocks, and while building a tower, you are also understanding how gravity works without even knowing the name. That's similar to how our brain learns things - by experience and adaptability. Neuromorphic engineering is like trying to make a toy robot that learns and understands things just like you do with your blocks.

### In-depth explanation
Neuromorphic engineering is the practice of creating synthetic brain systemsâ€”computational models that imitate the biological neural processing network seen in nature. This field fuses principles and methods from neuroscience, computer science, and electrical engineering to formulate hardware and software systems that can mimic the functions and processes of the human brain.

In other words, it's about building computer architectures that function similarly to biological nervous systems. While traditional computing structures separate memory (where data is stored) and processing units (where computations are performed), the brain, in fact, combines these functions in the form of neurons and synapses. Neuromorphic engineers strive to develop systems that combine these facets as well.

A key feature of neuromorphic engineering is creating artificial systems that are "spike-based" rather than "clock-based" as in traditional computing systems. In nature, neurons "spike," or send signals, based on stimuli, rather than on a repetitive clock cycle. This feature allows neuromorphic systems to function in a more power-efficient manner and respond to real-time stimuli with precision and speed, very much like living organisms.

Moreover, these architectures often involve learning rules, allowing the systems to adapt their behavior based on experience, leading to improved efficiency of computation and problem-solving - an artificial form of the plasticity observed in biological neural networks. This empowers neuromorphic systems to enhance their performance without explicit reprogramming.

Neuromorphic engineering is crucial for the development of more sophisticated AI and robotics, as systems based on these principles can self-adapt and learn in real-time. This is an advantage over other AI systems that rely on rigid algorithms and lack dynamism.

However, this field is still nascent, with ongoing research for creating superior neuromorphic devices. Some of the common challenges include the complexity of accurately modeling neuron functions, achieving scalability, and managing power usage efficiently.
