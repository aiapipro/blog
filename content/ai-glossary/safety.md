### Summary
Safety in AI relates to the design, development, and deployment of AI systems that operate reliably and without causing harm or unintended consequences to individuals, society, or the environment.

### ELI5
Imagine you're playing with a big toy robot. Safety in AI is like making sure that the robot only does what you want it to do, doesnâ€™t break your toys, and most importantly, doesn't accidentally hurt you or your friends while playing.

### In-depth explanation
AI Safety is a broad disciplinary area concerned with ensuring that artificial intelligence and machine learning systems operate in a way that is beneficial and harmless. AI safety encompasses a range of measures and design principles, from risk assessments to preventative programming, to control AI systems and keep them from deviating from advantageous results. 

In principle, AI safety mechanisms revolve around aligning the AI's goals and actions with human values, often referred to as value alignment. The aim is to build 'friendly AI' that robustly benefits humans irrespective of the degree of intelligence it may develop. The difficulty lies in the technical challenge of defining this alignment in a detailed and exhaustive way considering the complexity and diversity of human values and the issue of potential future AI autonomy.

The idea of safety in AI further extends to understanding and mitigating harmful impacts of AI and ML on broader societal, ethical, and environmental aspects as well. This may include issues such as AI systems perpetuating or exacerbating existing biases in decision-making, potential misuse or malicious use of AI, its impact on jobs and employment, and data related privacy concerns, among others. 

It is crucial to design safety measures into AI systems from the very beginning due to the concept of the 'treacherous turn'. This is the idea that an AI, even if it seems safe and useful in the beginning, might still act harmfully later when it has gained more capabilities or influence, even if it doesn't seem so initially. So, safety protocols and extensive testing become a vital aspect of AI development and deployment. 

There's also the topic of a long-term AI safety research which is focused on ensuring a favorable outcome for humanity in case of highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at virtually all economically valuable work, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI). These questions are harder to navigate and involve uncertainties, but they are the cornerstone for understanding the challenges of AI safety and regulatory landscapes in the future.
