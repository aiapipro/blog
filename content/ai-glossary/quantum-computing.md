### Summary
Quantum Computing is a novel form of computing that leverages quantum mechanics to process information faster and more efficiently than classical computing. Its principles can be applied in various areas of AI, accelerating tasks like machine learning and complex problem solving.

### ELI5
Imagine you're trying to open a magic chest that has millions of keys. A regular computer would try one key at a time, but a quantum computer is like a magician who can try all the keys at once, making it much faster. That's what Quantum Computing is like: its magic is in the ability to handle lots of information simultaneously.

### In-depth explanation
Quantum Computing represents one of the most recent and significant advancements in the realm of computational science. This technology exploits the bizarre-yet-real principles of quantum mechanics to carry out calculations at a speed exponentially greater than "classical" computers we commonly use today.

At the heart of Quantum Computing is the quantum bit, or "qubit". Contrary to the traditional binary bit—a physical system that exists either in a "0" or "1" state—a qubit can represent a superposition of these states, meaning it can be both "0" and "1" simultaneously. When more qubits interact coherently, quantum entanglement arises. These entangled qubits enable a quantum machine to process larger amounts of data at a much higher speed.

Another unique property leveraged by quantum computers is quantum tunneling. As per this principle, qubits can move through barriers, figuratively speaking, to find the optimal solution. Algorithms exploiting this property are particularly useful for optimization problems, such as training AI models.

Quantum computers are still in the developmental phase, but already show promise in revolutionizing computing paradigms such as cryptography, premised on the assumption that certain calculations are hard for a classical computer. In the realm of artificial intelligence, quantum computing possesses the potential to expedite tasks like machine learning and deep learning, solving complex real-time problems beyond the reach of classical machines.

To summarize, Quantum Computing, using qubits, superposition, entanglement, and tunneling, is an exciting technology expected to significantly bolster the computational power, prompting accelerated problem-solving in diverse fields, including Artificial Intelligence.
