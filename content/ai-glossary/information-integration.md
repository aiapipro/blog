### Summary
Information Integration refers to the amalgamation of information from disparate sources to produce a unified, coherent understanding. It's about ensuring accurate data is available in the right place at the right time. It forms the backbone of many AI/ML systems that depend on diverse datasets.

### ELI5
Imagine you have a puzzle, but the pieces are scattered across multiple boxes. Information Integration is like sorting through all those boxes, gathering all the puzzle pieces, and fitting them together to see the complete picture. Just like different pieces form a whole puzzle, different bits of data, when integrated, form the full information.

### In-depth explanation
Information Integration (I2) is pivotal in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), and deals with combining data that resides in different sources and providing the user with a unified view of the data. The main objective of I2 is to generate significant value by providing a coherent, comprehensive view of data across disparate sources.

In the realm of AI/ML, Information Integration is crucial to the development of effective models. These models frequently require large and diverse datasets, which are often derived from a variety of data sources such as databases, spreadsheets, internet resources, or systems logs. Information from these different sources is integrated to develop a comprehensive dataset that can be utilized by AI algorithms.

Information Integration includes processes such as data preprocessing, where data go through a certain process to format, cleanse, and compile them. It's common to encounter various difficulties during these steps, for instance, discrepancies in data formats, issues with data quality, or problems linked to data security and privacy. 

I2 also often needs to address challenges related to semantic heterogeneity, where the same term may mean different things in different contexts. It's important to reconcile such conflicts so that the final integrated data doesnâ€™t distort conclusions drawn from it.

Such challenges highlight the necessity for robust I2 techniques and tools, which are subjects of consistent research. They may make use of approaches from multiple domains such as data mining, data warehousing, distributed databases, data cleansing, and data conversion.

Overall, Information Integration is a key task in AI/ML, helping gather data from different sources to form a coherent, unified dataset that adds value to the AI algorithms that utilize it.
