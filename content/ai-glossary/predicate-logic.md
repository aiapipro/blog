### Summary
Predicate logic is a mathematical language used to build complex statements from simpler ones, and to identify their validity. In AI, it's used within knowledge representation and inferencing systems, acting as the building blocks of logic-based AI systems.

### ELI5
Imagine you're playing with different kinds of building blocks. Some are simple - like red and blue blocks, and some are a bit complex - like blocks with wheels or propellers. You stack them together in various ways to build cool toys! Predicate logic is just like that, but for ideas instead of blocks. It's a way to take simple ideas and combine them to create complex ones in a structured way that makes them easy to understand.

### In-depth explanation
Predicate logic, also called predicate calculus or first-order logic, is a type of formal logical system. It is more expressive than propositional logic, allowing statements to be made in a structured way about predicates - functions with a certain condition - which can either be true or false.

These predicates are typically in the form of a sentence like "x is red", this consists of a variable 'x', a predicate 'is red' and becomes true when 'x' is in fact red. Expressions can also include quantifiers such as 'for all' (∀) and 'there exists' (∃), further increasing expressiveness. 

In AI, predicate logic serves a significant role in creating rule-based systems, expert systems, and certain aspects of natural language processing. By enabling clearly structured and logically valid knowledge representation, it forms a foundation for reason-based AI mechanisms. In automated theorem proving and symbolic reasoning-based models, predicate logic offers an effective toolset.

One popular use is in logic programming and languages like Prolog. Here, a program's function is based on a set of axioms and rules of inference, providing a specific implementation of predicate logic principles. 

However, while predicate logic is a powerful tool, it isn't without limits. For instance, it cannot make statements about itself, a property required for Gödel's completeness theorem, hence, it is not a complete system.
