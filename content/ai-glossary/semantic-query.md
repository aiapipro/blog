### Summary
A semantic query is an intelligent approach to retrieve information, which utilizes understanding of the meaning of data rather than simple keyword matching. It leverages AI capabilities to interpret abstract concepts to bring more relevance and efficiency in data retrieval.

### ELI5
Imagine you're looking for your favorite toy among piles of other toys. Instead of just searching for the toy by its name, you remember that it's a red car and plays a jingle, and search this way. This is akin to a semantic query. It understands what you are seeking and looks for things close to that, not only by name, but by meaning and other characteristics.

### In-depth explanation
The concept of a 'Semantic Query' pivots around a more intelligent and intuitive method of retrieving data. This method goes beyond traditional keyword search, where results are fetched based solely on matching terms. Semantic query brings deeper semantic understanding into play, interpreting the meaning of queried elements, while considering the relationships between them. 

This level of understanding allows for improved relevancy of search results, enabling the system to better infer the user's intent and bring out more pertinent results. For instance, a semantic query can understand that a search for 'climate change effects' should also fetch results on 'global warming impacts', even if the keywords donâ€™t match exactly. 

Beyond conventional retrieval, it also allows for asking questions in a natural language format, making it more user-friendly and intuitive. Technically, semantic querying is facilitated by techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, along with structured data formats that enable machines to understand terms and their relationships.

In its implementation, semantic querying often relies on Knowledge Graphs. These are network representations of data, where nodes represent entities and the edges represent relationships between those entities. Knowledge Graphs are built using semantic web technologies like RDF (Resource Description Framework), SPARQL (a query language for RDF), and OWL (Web Ontology Language), which establish a common framework to share and reuse data across applications.

Despite its advantages, semantic querying also has its challenges. Developing the AI capabilities for understanding semantics can be technically complex, requiring the careful design of architectures and algorithms. Further, the use of structured data formats means that the data needs to be in a particular form, which can impose pre-processing overheads.

Despite the challenges, the benefits of semantic querying in terms of relevance, accuracy, and user experience make it an important concept in data retrieval and AI. Its ability to understand the user's intent and provide highly relevant results is at the core of many AI applications like voice assistants, search engines, recommendation systems and many others.
