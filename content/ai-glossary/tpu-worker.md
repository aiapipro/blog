### Summary
A TPU Worker is essentially a device that processes tasks using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Google's custom-developed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which are specifically built for high-speed machine learning computations.

### ELI5
Imagine you're building a big LEGO set. Instead of doing all the work yourself, you ask your super-fast friend, specially trained in LEGO-building, to help out. Here, the LEGO set is a huge machine learning task, you are the CPU (the brain of the computer), and your super-fast friend is the TPU Worker.

### In-depth explanation
A TPU Worker manages one or more Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), high-performance machine learning accelerators developed by Google. TPUs are designed to accelerate matrix manipulations and convolutions, key operations in deep learning algorithms, with a specific emphasis on TensorFlow operations, though other machine learning frameworks can also benefit.

TPU Workers function as part of the larger TPU system, encapsulating the TPU devices and their related resources, like TPU cores and memory. A TPU Worker can manage multiple TPU devices, allowing it to handle several tasks in parallel or to perform particularly large-scale computations.

TPUs differ from CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs (graphics processing units) in that they are specifically designed for tensor computations, the core operations in deep learning models. Because of this specialisation, TPUs can deliver significantly higher performance in these operations than general-purpose processors.

In terms of software, a TPU Worker can be interacted with via high-level machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow. These frameworks provide APIs to distribute the ML workloads across the TPU resources in a semi-automatic way. The programmer mainly needs to specify the model, the data and the task, and the framework together with the TPU system take care of parallelizing the computation, synchronizing devices, and managing memory.

Tensorflow's distribution strategy API, for instance, can create a mirrored variable on each TPU in the TPU Worker, enabling model parameters to be kept in sync across the TPUs as training progresses. Various other strategies for distributing the work across TPUs are also possible, such as pipelining computation across multiple stages.

To sum up, a TPU Worker is a crucial player in high-performance ML computations, offering the ability to manage and harness one or more TPUs. It functions within the broader TPU system, providing a route for programmers to interact with and utilise the power of TPUs within their machine learning tasks.
