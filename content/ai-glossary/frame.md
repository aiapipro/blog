### Summary
A "Frame" in AI is a type of knowledge representation structure. It encapsulates entities and situations into defined, reusable structures, thus simplifying data processing and information exchange within AI systems.

### ELI5
Think about how we tell stories. We have characters with certain attributes, and situations that hinge upon these attributes. Each "character" is a frame with attributes like name, age, or jobs. Each "situation" is another frame, like a birthday party, with attributes such as location and attendees. In AI, we use the concept of frames to represent and organize these stories in a similar way.

### In-depth explanation
Frames in artificial intelligence (AI) are structures for representing stereotyped situations, like 'living room' or 'birthday party'. Frames are built around nodes which stand for objects or events, and are interconnected through fixed relationships or attributes, allowing knowledge to be hierarchically organized. They are an outgrowth of semantic networks, and alongside symbolic AI methods, such as logic and rules, form the basis of knowledge representation in AI.

Each frame contains fixed properties and variable slots, where the properties could be considered as the attributes or features of the entity or situation the frame represents. These properties or slots can in turn be filled by other frames, creating a complex interconnected web of knowledge. This approach allows to describe complex scenarios and relationships in an intuitive and manageable way, akin to object-oriented programming.

As an example, consider 'indoor scenes' frame representing different variants of indoor situations. Different sub-frames like 'living room', 'kitchen', 'bedroom' etc. may be attached to the 'indoor scenes' frame. The 'living room' frame will have slots for the usual constituent parts of a living room such as 'sofa', 'television', 'coffee table' etc.

Frames play a major role in research areas like Natural Language Processing (NLP) where understanding the context or 'frame' of the conversation is crucial. For instance, FrameNet project embodies this idea using frame semantic theory to map meaning in a structured way. Even object recognition models in computer vision can utilize the frame concept, analyzing not just isolated items, but their connections and contexts.

Frames have their limitations as well, such as inability to handle ambiguous queries and unexpected situations since they are designed for specific stereotypical situations. To overcome these shortcomings, AI systems often deploy a combination of frames along with other strategies like rule-based systems, ontology, bayesian networks etc.

Despite their limitations, frames provide a simple, intuitive, and flexible means of representing and reasoning with knowledge in AI, and they remain a key tool in the AI practitioner's toolkit.
