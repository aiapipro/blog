### Summary

Programming, in the context of AI, is the process of creating intelligent systems by writing instructions in a human-understandable language (programming language) that computers can interpret and execute. It's the foundational process where algorithms and models are constructed and implemented to enable AI functionalities.

Imagine you have a very smart robot and want it to make a sandwich for you. But the robot doesn't know how unless you tell it exactly what to do, step by step: get two slices of bread, take some cheese, and so on. Programming in AI is like telling that robot how to make a sandwich, but instead of sandwiches, you're teaching the robot (your computer or an AI system) how to understand language, recognize images, play games, or do other cool things!

### In-depth explanation

Programming in the context of AI is an intricate process that involves creating, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code, written in a programming language, is a set of directives that tell a computer or an AI model what to do and how to do it. 

It often starts with formulating a problem to be solved, designing the logic and flow to address the problem, and finally implementing this logic in the form of a program using the syntax and semantics of a chosen programming language. The choice of programming language can greatly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of an AI system. Languages like Python and R have extensive libraries and tools for machine learning and statistical analysis, making them popular choices in the AI field. 

For AI specifically, programming can involve designing and training machine learning algorithms, constructing neural networks for deep learning, or writing rules and logic for expert systems, among others. 

In machine learning, the 'instructions' written in the program are often flexible and able to learn from data. The program might start off not knowing much about the task it needs to perform, but as it receives more and more data, it 'learns' to improve its performance. 

In deep learning, a subset of machine learning, programming involves creating neural networks, which are systems modeled after the human brain. These networks learn from a vast amount of data and can perform complex tasks like recognizing objects in images or understanding natural human language.

Programming for AI also involves a great deal of debugging and testing, as inaccuracies and mistakes in the code can lead to undesirable outputs or system behaviors. Validation procedures are implemented to ensure that the AI program is working as intended and making accurate predictions. 

Thus, while programming for AI shares many aspects with general programming, it also requires a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms, statistics, and data analysis.
