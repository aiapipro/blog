### Summary
Pathfinding constitutes the crucial task of identifying the most optimal route, or path, between two points. It is a fundamental concept in computer science, often employed in scenarios from video game design to robotic navigation.

### ELI5
Imagine you are in a maze and you want to find the quickest way out. You start exploring different ways. Some paths lead to dead-ends, and some paths lead you closer to the exit. This is what pathfinding is like in AI. It’s the process of figuring out the shortest or most efficient route from point A (where you are) to point B (the exit).

### In-depth explanation
Pathfinding in artificial intelligence (AI) is a computational problem focused on plotting an efficiently directed path between multiple points, typically a starting point and a goal. It is a fundamental pillar of many AI applications—ranging from autonomous vehicle route planning, to strategy-based video game AI, to robot navigation in dynamic environments.

At the heart of pathfinding are algorithms, with one of the most recognized being the A* (pronounced A-star) algorithm. Given a graph of nodes, which could represent cities, grid points on a map, etc., A* is designed to find a path that minimises the sum of the distances (or costs) between the nodes travelled. It does this by leveraging a heuristic function that estimates the minimum cost to reach the goal from a given node, cutting down on the search space.

Dijkstra’s algorithm is another important algorithm used for pathfinding. Dijkstra’s algorithm is similar to A*, but it doesn't use a heuristic—instead, it considers all possible paths.

The notion of an "optimal" path can be context dependent. It could represent the shortest physical distance, the least time consumed, or any domain-specific criteria.

Pathfinding becomes more complex as the environment becomes increasingly dynamic, necessitating real-time decision-making adjustments based on changing contextual information. This is where reinforcement learning can come into play, a subfield of AI where software agents learn how to act in an environment to maximise a reward signal.

However, pathfinding and the application of such algorithms come with several challenges. Heuristic function design, space complexity, and time complexity, especially in large or dynamic environments, are a few key concerns that need to be addressed while developing and deploying pathfinding algorithms in AI systems.
