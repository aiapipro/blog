### Summary
Data Protection in AI encompasses methods to safeguard the collected, processed, and stored data against unauthorized access and corruption. It ensures privacy, security, and trustworthiness of data, while adhering to regulations and industry standards.

Imagine if you had a treasure chest full of your favorite toys. You wouldn't like if someone took your toys without asking, right? Data Protection is like a lock for that treasure chest. It ensures that data, or "information" in the world of AI, is kept safe and secure, and only the right people can use it. 

### In-depth explanation
In the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Protection refers to the processes and tools used to preserve the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of data. AI relies heavily on data - these could be anything from numerical values, images, to text. This data can include sensitive information such as personal identification data, financial records, and other proprietary information. 

Data Protection is important because AI algorithms often require large quantities of data for training and making accurate predictions. Unauthorized access or tampering with this data can have serious consequences, including making erroneous predictions, learning from tampered data, and violation of individual privacy. Moreover, loss or corruption of data could impact the performance of AI systems and hinder their development.

There are many aspects to data protection in AI. Some of the most essential ones are data privacy and data security. Data privacy ensures that the data used in AI systems respects the confidentiality and privacy of individuals who may be identified by that data. Data security ensures that AI systems' data is safe from unauthorized access and tampering.

Methods for data protection involve secure data storage options, like encrypted databases, to ensure that the data cannot easily be deciphered if accessed. Practices such as data anonymization and pseudonymization make it harder to link data to specific individuals, thus protecting their privacy. In infrastructure security, firewalling and network segregation prevent unauthorized access to the data.

AI trained models can also leak sensitive information from their training data, hence, robust model training techniques like differential privacy and federated learning are used where data safety is a concern.

Data protection regulations and standards play a key role, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, which sets strict guidelines on data processing and storage and ensures that individual privacy is respected.
