### Summary
A socio-technical system in AI refers to an approach that recognises both the social and technical aspects of a system and how they interact. It emphasizes holistic, system-focused design and stress importance of understanding complex interdependencies between humans and technology.

### ELI5
Imagine a city. It has buildings, roads, and cars – those are like the technical parts. But there's also people – drivers, pedestrians, shopkeepers. They follow rules and interact with the technical parts, like how a driver uses a car. For the city to work well, both parts – people and the city's infrastructure – have to interact well. That's like a socio-technical system but applied to AI.

### In-depth explanation
Socio-technical systems theory is an approach to understanding the complex interactions between social and technical systems. It originated in the field of organizational studies, and has since been applied across a variety of disciplines, including AI and ML.

A key principle of this theory is that the interaction of the social and technical aspects of a system create an overall behaviour that cannot be reduced to just the sum of the individual social and technical parts. This means that in socio-technical systems, we cannot fully understand the system by just looking at its social components or its technical components separately.

In the context of AI and ML, a socio-technical system could include AI algorithms and the technical infrastructure being used, as well as the people using the system, the societal context it's being used in, the rules governing its use, and the impact it has on the people and society.

Take self-driving cars as an example. The technical aspects include the hardware (sensors, cameras, the car itself) and the software (the AI driving system). The social aspects include diverse factors like the users, legal and regulatory systems, prevailing cultural norms about cars and driving, the infrastructure like roads and traffic signage, and the wider impacts of adopting self-driving cars on employment and city planning.

Creating an effective socio-technical system means ensuring these diverse elements work well together. Socio-technical design often involves iterative testing and refining, and needs to handle ethical, legal, and societal issues as well as technical ones.
