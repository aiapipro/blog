### Summary
Name Binding, within artificial intelligence, refers to the process of associating variable names with the specific values or sets of values they represent. This process allows developers to abstract away from specific data, making their models more accurate, flexible, and scalable.

### ELI5
Imagine you have a box, and you want to refer to what's inside the box. Instead of saying "the thing in the box" all the time, you decide to give it a name, like "mystery object". Now, when you want to think or talk about what's in the box, you just say "mystery object". In AI, this is like where we give a name to a certain value or data. This name is 'bound' to the data it represents, and this process is what we call "Name Binding".

### In-depth explanation
In programming languages, and notably in data science and artificial intelligence programming, we deal with values through symbols called variables. These variables are symbolic names that are associated with values stored in the machine's memory. The association between a variable name and the value it represents is known as "Name Binding".

Name Binding in artificial intelligence encompasses the pairing of variable labels—like x, y, input— to specific values. These values might be matrices, numbers, coordinates, or anything else being manipulated by the AI algorithms. The binding relationship is essential because it allows the AI to abstract from specifics, thus enabling it to take any input (within the relevant value set). To visualize, you might think of Name Binding like an associative table, where the variable names are on one side and their corresponding values on the other.

Name Binding is also essential for managing scope in programming. A 'scope' is the region of a program where a binding is valid. For example, in a Python function, the variables assigned within the function usually have a local scope – they are bound only within the confines of that function.

Part of the power of Name Binding is that it provides flexibility in AI programming. By working with variable names instead of direct values, the same lines of code can handle varying data inputs, making the machine learning model or AI system scalable. In deep learning, Name Binding provides the required abstractions for dealing with large and complex neural networks. As these networks encompass vast arrays of nodes and connections, the variable names bound to parts of the network allow it easier to manage, modify, and compute.

The type-checking policies, which may be either static or dynamic depending on the programming language, also have implications for name binding. In statically typed languages, choosing the type of value to which a name is bound happens at compile time, thus enforcing strict variable name binding. Conversely, for dynamically typed languages, this occurs at run time, giving more flexibility in name binding.
