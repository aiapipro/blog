### Summary
Stochastic Semantic Analysis (SSA) is a powerful technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that combines probability with the interpretation of text data. It aids in revealing hidden linguistic structures and understanding the semantic meaning of words in complex corpuses.

### ELI5
Imagine you have a magic magnifying glass. When you look at a book through it, you can see what the words mean and how they connect, even if the book is very complicated and you never saw the words before. Stochastic Semantic Analysis is like that magnifying glass for computer programs, helping them understand language.

### In-depth explanation
Stochastic Semantic Analysis (SSA) is an approach used to interpret large and complex bodies of text, termed as 'corpuses'. It uses mathematical theory and computer science principles to discover underlying semantic structures in these corpuses. SSA is considered a variant of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) that employs probabilistic modeling, considering the stochastic nature of linguistic data.

At the heart of SSA is the creation of semantic spaces - a multi-dimensional representation of words in the corpus based on their usage and context. This principled low-dimensional embedding brings together semantically close words. Two words are close in the semantic space if they are syntactically and semantically similar, and far apart otherwise. 

The stochastic aspect of SSA is rooted in the application of probability theory. The idea is to consider the presence of a word in a context as a random event and compute the probability of its occurrence. This probability is then used to gauge the 'closeness' of words in the semantic space, aiding in understanding their relationship and semantic meaning. 

Another critical component is SSA's iterative algorithmic procedure for obtaining the semantic spaces, which involves repeated sampling and probabilistic updates. By interpreting language stochastically, SSA adds a robustness feature to the semantic analysis, which allows it to adapt to evolving language patterns and cope with variations and uncertainties found in natural languages. 

SSA has wide-ranging applications, especially in the realm of Natural Language Processing. It can be employed for document routing, information retrieval, text clustering and categorization, sentiment analysis, and other tasks where understanding semantic relationships between words is crucial.
