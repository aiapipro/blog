### Summary
Abstraction in AI refers to simplifying complex problems into manageable components, making it easier to design and implement AI algorithms. It involves reducing and organizing information about a problem domain, allowing AI to focus on essential concepts.

### ELI5
Imagine you're trying to build a castle using LEGO bricks. Instead of thinking about every single brick, you think in terms of walls, towers, and gates; those are your building blocks or 'abstractions'. Similarly, in AI, 'abstraction' means breaking down a big, complicated problem into simpler parts so that it's easier to solve.

### In-depth explanation
The concept of abstraction, adopted from general computer science, is fundamental in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). In an AI context, abstraction is used to simplify complex systems and problems, facilitating their description, understanding, and programming. The process involves filtering out unnecessary details while keeping essential features, enabling a focus on higher-level concepts rather than specifics.

An illustrative example is designing a chess-playing AI algorithm. Instead of focusing on the specifics, like individual pixel colors on the screen representing the chessboard, we use the abstraction of a 2D array with different values representing different pieces. This simplifies the problem and allows us to focus on strategic aspects of the game.

There are various forms of abstraction used in AI, including data abstraction, control abstraction, and hardware abstraction. Data abstraction involves structuring and organising data in ways that make it easier for an AI to process. For instance, in ML, raw data could be abstracted into feature vectors, mathematical formulations that retain the essential characteristics of the data.

Control abstraction refers to simplifying the design of a system by encapsulating complex processes in a function or module. For instance, an ML algorithm might have a 'train' function, encapsulating the intricate steps of model training.

Hardware abstraction involves creating software models of hardware elements, allowing AI developers to ignore hardware-specific details. This is used, for instance, when developing ML algorithms that can run on different types of processors without changes to the algorithm code.

These forms of abstraction promote scalability, generalizability, and maintainability. They allow AI professionals to tackle more complex problems by managing the inherent complexity in a more structured, organised manner.
