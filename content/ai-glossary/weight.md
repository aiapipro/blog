### Summary
Weight in AI refers to the value of a connection between nodes in a neural network. This value determines the strength and direction of the influence of one node over another and is crucial for the network's ability to learn from data and make predictions.

### ELI5
Imagine you are trying to make a delicious soup. Each ingredient you add (like salt, pepper, vegetables) changes the taste a little bit. In a similar way, a computer uses 'weights' to adjust how much each piece of information contributes to the final result - just like how much salt you put in your soup affects its taste.

### In-depth explanation
In the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly machine learning (ML), weights play a central role in the design and operation of neural networks. A neural network consists of interconnected nodes, also known as neurons, which are grouped into layers. Each connection between these nodes is associated with a numerical value called a 'weight'. 

Weights convey the strength and direction of the influence that one node has over another. When the network receives input data, these data propagate through the network, with each weight influencing the degree to which the associated feature (a particular property of the data, like an ingredient in the soup) contributes to the final output.

The goal of training a neural network is fundamentally an exercise in weight adjustment. The weights initially start at random values and get iteratively updated in response to the discrepancy between the network's predictions and the actual outcomes, a difference known as the error. This error is propagated back through the network, a process known as backpropagation, adjusting the weights to minimize the error.

Often, the adjustment is scaled by a learning rate - a hyperparameter that determines how fast or slow the learning happens. If the learning rate is high, the weights can change dramatically, and the model might overshoot the 'ideal' weights. If it's too low, the learning might be slow and might never reach that 'ideal' state.

The objective of this process is to find the set of weights that will result in the lowest possible prediction error for the particular task at hand, such as recognizing images or predicting stock prices. It's this sensitive interplay between the weights, data, and error that makes learning possible in a neural network.

Important to note that having too many weights, which typically occurs in a very complex network with too many neurons and/or layers, can lead to overfitting. Overfitting is when the network becomes so adept at learning the training data that it fails to generalize well to unseen data. The opposite, underfitting, can occur with too few weights or if the learning rate is set too low.
