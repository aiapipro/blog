### Summary
Semantic Computing is an area of computer science that aims to bridge human and computer understanding by interpreting the meaning behind data. It involves a variety of techniques to translate human language into computer-understandable data and vice versa.

### ELI5
Think of semantic computing like a translator between humans and computers. If humans talk in words and sentences, computers talk in numbers and code. When we use words like "apple", a computer might not understand what we're talking about. But in semantic computing, we teach the computer that "apple" means a round fruit that can be red or green. This way, we and the computer can understand each other better.

### In-depth explanation
Semantic Computing refers to an area of research that involves designing and developing systems that can understand and interpret human language and context in computer understandable formats. This area of computing fundamentally involves the translation of human language into machine language while retaining the underlying meaning or intent. It combines multiple branches of computer science including natural language processing, data mining, and machine learning, among others.

Semantic computing technologies include but are not limited to: metadata and metadata linkage, knowledge discovery from text and data mining, information retrieval, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Interpreting semantics is not restricted to understanding language alone. It can also involve interpreting other forms of human communication such as visual cues or sounds. Therefore, it also integrates computer vision and speech recognition technologies in order to better imitate human cognitive tasks.

One primary application of semantic computing is in the domain of search algorithms where instead of returning results based on keyword matching, semantic search engines understand the context and intended meaning of the user's query. For instance, if a user queries "eiffel", a semantically intelligent algorithm could determine if the user is referring to the "Eiffel Tower", "Eiffel programming language", or "Eiffel Software".

Such applications further extend into more complex domains tying in with artificial intelligence. For example, in natural language processing, semantic computing plays a crucial role for human-computer dialog, where the computer needs to understand the human language context to generate meaningful responses.

Moreover, semantic computing acts as a gateway for advanced data analytics. While traditional data analytics focuses more on structured data, semantic computing can interpret, categorize and analyze massive volumes of unstructured data, like video, audio or text files. This aids in identifying hidden patterns and insights that wouldn't be possible with traditional approaches.
