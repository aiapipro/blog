### Summary
A splitter is a utility used in machine learning to divide data into distinct subsets, typically for training, validation, and testing procedures. It helps ensure that models are trained and evaluated accurately and robustly.

### ELI5
Imagine you're learning how to bake a cake. You have a book of 100 different cake recipes, but you don't want to use them all at once. So, you select 70 recipes to practice with, 15 recipes to tweak until they're just perfect, and the remaining 15 to test your baking skills. That's exactly what a splitter doesâ€”it divides all your data (recipes) into different groups for different purposes.

### In-depth explanation
In the field of machine learning, a splitter is a crucial tool for data partitioning. It separates data into different subsets, which are conventionally labeled as the training set, the validation set, and the test set. This process is fundamental to effective model development and evaluation.

The training set is used to educate the model, adjusting its parameters, essentially enabling it to learn from their data. The validation set, on the other hand, allows for hyperparameter tuning and provides an initial check on the model's performance. Lastly, the test set serves to evaluate the final model's performance, offering an unbiased estimate of how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Typically, the split is performed randomly yet maintains the original data's distribution, which helps ensure each set's representativeness. The splitting ratio is often determined based on the size and characteristics of the dataset, and the specific project requirements, although a common practice is a 70:15:15 or 80:10:10 partitioning.

One common form of splitter is the train_test_split function available in the Python's Scikit-Learn library. Another variant, the K-Fold cross-validator, partitions the data into 'K' equally sized folds, and for each fold, it trains the model on the remaining 'K-1' parts and then validates it on the isolated part. This method ensures that each data point has been in the test set exactly once and in the training set 'K-1' times.

While extremely useful, splitters must be used thoughtfully, taking into account potential data leakage and ensuring the data in the validation and testing phases draw from the same distribution as the training data.
