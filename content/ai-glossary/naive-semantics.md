### Summary
Naive Semantics is a simplified approach to understanding the meaning of words and sentences in natural language processing. It takes the literal meaning of language data, assuming it has one consistent interpretation.

### ELI5
Imagine you're reading a storybook. In Naive Semantics, every word, phrase, or sentence in the book is believed to have just one simple meaning. Like if someone says "It's raining cats and dogs," naive semantics assumes itâ€™s literally raining pets, and not that it's a metaphor for heavy rain.

### In-depth explanation
Naive Semantics is an approach in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch of artificial intelligence concerning the interaction between computers and human languages. It's called "naive" because it simplistically interprets language data as possessing a singular, unambiguous, literal meaning.

For example, considering the phrase "I saw a jaguar in the garage." A naive semantics approach might interpret it exclusively as seeing a large jungle cat in the garage, not considering the alternative interpretation of a Jaguar brand car. It doesn't account for context, underlying metaphors, or idiomatic expressions. 

The methodology is relatively straightforward to implement but has obvious limitations. Language, especially natural human language, is incredibly nuanced and complex with a vast range of metaphoric phrases, idioms, and context-dependent meanings rarely considered within the naive semantics framework.

Naive Semantics can benefit from techniques used in Machine Learning to improve interpretations, such as the use of lexicons or semantic networks. However, due to its limitations, advanced NLP systems often employ more nuanced methodologies, such as sentiment analysis, word embeddings, or deep learning models, which aim to better capture the richness and flexibility of natural language.

Nonetheless, naive semantics remains a useful instructional tool and preliminary step in language processing tasks. It's used for foundational, algorithmic simplicity in comprehension tasks where the risk associated with potential misinterpretation is of lesser consequence.
