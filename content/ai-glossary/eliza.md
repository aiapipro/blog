### Summary

ELIZA is an early, influential example of natural language processing in AI, developed in the 1960s. It emulated a psychotherapist, simulating conversation with users through pattern recognition and response generation.

### ELI5

Imagine having a chat with a parrot that has learned how to answer you by using your own words, and sometimes making it feel like you're having a real conversation. This is similar to ELIZA, a computer program built long time ago that could make you think it's a human.

### In-depth explanation

ELIZA, created by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT from 1964 to 1966, is one of the earliest instances of Artificial Intelligence. It's a computer program created to demonstrate how superficial human-computer interaction can be. 

While primitive by today's standards, ELIZA used techniques including keyword recognition, text manipulation, and pre-prepared scripts to provide responses. Its most famous script, named DOCTOR, posed as a Rogerian psychotherapist, often giving vague responses like "Tell me more about that" to redirect the conversation back to the user.

ELIZA operated mainly by using simple pattern matching techniques to parse the user's sentences. It did not have the capability of understanding the input in the way humans do; instead, it worked by reshuffling elements of the user's statements and posing them as questions. 

ELIZA had a significant role in influencing the course of AI for several reasons. One, it clearly put forth questions about the depth of understanding required to have meaningful human-computer interactions. Two, it led to continuing research in the realm of chatbots and Conversational AI, leading to many of the natural language processing applications we see today.  

However, its simplistic methodology also resulted in naive implications about AI's capabilities at the time. People often perceived ELIZA as understanding and responding to their conversation, when in reality, the responses were generated without any comprehension. This invoked debates on the ethical implications of AI â€“ a discourse that remains prominent to this day.
