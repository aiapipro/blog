### Summary
"Description Logic" is a type of formal logic crucial to understanding artificial intelligence, particularly in knowledge representation and reasoning. It's a way to describe and classify knowledge about real-world scenarios systematically, enabling AI systems to deduce new facts from existing ones.

### ELI5
Imagine you have a box of Legos. Each piece has certain characteristics, like its color, shape, or size. Now, if you have a guidebook (rules), you can build different things using these Lego pieces. Description Logic is like the guidebook for AI. It gives the AI a set of rules about the world and helps it understand what it can build or deduce using the information (Lego pieces) it has.

### In-depth explanation
Description Logic (DL) is a family of formal knowledge representation (KR) languages that’s used in artificial intelligence for defining structured, complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relationships between things. A key feature of DL is its capability to infer implicit knowledge from explicit facts and rules.

DL defines a structured framework that allows entities (concepts), roles (relationships between entities), and individuals (instances of entities). One of the powerful features of DLs is the provision for defining concepts and roles using constructors. These constructors could be logical connectives including conjunction “and”, disjunction “or”, negation “not”. Also provided are quantifiers including existential "there exists" and universal "for all".

In the DL language, a ontology is created which comprises a set of assertions about classes and individuals. DL supports explicit typing of individuals and relationships which enriches the ontology with a type hierarchy. This is often used to enable reasoning services such as subsumption checking, which is determining whether one concept is more general than another, and satisfiability checking, which is determining whether a concept has any instances.

A key strength of DL is its ability to balance expressivity (the complexity of facts it can express) and decidability (the guarantee that an algorithm exists that can determine whether a statement is true or false). This balance is crucial to DL’s effectiveness in AI and ML where it is important to both capture complex representations and be able to make definitive decisions on the basis of them.

As an AI subfield, researchers have been successful in applying DL to various domains including natural language processing (NLP), object recognition, and automated planning, by representing the inherent structure and using the tools provided by the DL to reason about it.
