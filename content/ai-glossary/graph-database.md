### Summary
A Graph Database is a type of NoSQL database that uses the graph theory for storing, mapping and querying data. The key concept is the utilization of nodes, edges, and properties, which facilitates complex interconnections and data relationships.

### ELI5
Imagine you are at a party, where everyone is connected to each other in some way. You can think of persons as "nodes", relationships among them as "edges", and any specifics about them (like their favorite color) are properties. A Graph Database is a lot like that party, but for data.

### In-depth explanation
A Graph Database, derived from Graph Theory, is designed to handle data where complex relationships and interconnections exist. The primary elements of a Graph Database are 'nodes', 'edges' and 'properties'. Nodes represent entities, like people, things, categories, or events. Edges, which can be directed or undirected, symbolize the relationships or interactions between nodes. By comparison, relational databases would need to join multiple tables to establish these kind of relationships, which can consume more processing power with significant data volume.

Further, each node and edge can have properties or attributes associated to it. These properties provide contextual information and can be of various types such as numerical, categorical, or textual. This augmentative feature adds immense expressiveness and versatility to Graph Databases.

In the context of AI and ML, Graph Databases can play a pivotal role in numerous applications. They are particularly useful where relationships and connections need to be traversed rapidly (due to inherent indexing on edges), like recommendation engines, social networks, mapping applications, pattern detection, and even in complex problems like fraud detection or sub-graph pattern matching.

For instance, let's consider a recommendation system. If a user liked a particular book, you can track down other users who liked the same book, based on relationships established in the Graph Database. Then, books liked by those users can be recommended to the initial user.

Moreover, Graph Databases allow for graph-specific query languages, bringing a more natural, human-readable approach to data exploration. Neo4j's Cypher and Amazon Neptune's Gremlin are notable examples.

Despite their many advantages, Graph Databases also have their limitations. They can be less performant when dealing with operations that treat the data as a whole, unlike Relational Databases. Also, they may require more memory to store the data due to granular details of relationships and properties.
