### Summary
Feature extraction is a pivotal process in machine learning where initial raw data is transformed or extracted to better represent the underlying patterns. This process allows our algorithms to work more effectively, reducing computational processing and improving overall model performance.

### ELI5
Think of feature extraction like taking a lot of messy play-doh (raw data) and reshaping it into something really specific, like a train or a gang of dinosaurs (desired features). This simpler, meaningful shape reduces the play-doh mess and is easier to show to our friends (the machine learning model) to understand it!

### In-depth explanation
The process of feature extraction involves encoding algorithm variables in the most informative and compact manner. It constitutes a critical step in machine learning and pattern recognition. It's an essential aspect of the "preprocessing" stage in the ML development pipeline.

Simply put, feature extraction denotes the load reduction step where an initial set of raw data variables is reduced to a more manageable group, constituting critical 'features' for a given problem. The main goal is to identify and remove redundant or irrelevant data that doesn't contribute to the predictive accuracy of the model.

For instance, suppose an image is used in machine learning. The raw data would entail the values of every pixel, an overwhelming amount of information. However, not all pixels equally contribute to distinguishing it - some pixels in the background, such as a grey wall, can add noise without providing useful information. Extracting key features like edges, color channels, or keypoints, would produce a more compact yet representative "feature" set.

One technique extensively used for feature extraction is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which reduces dimensionality by transforming the input into a small orthogonal set of variables. Other methods include Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), which seeks directions maximizing class separation.

In deep learning, the layers of a neural network perform feature extraction autonomously. Earlier layers often encode low-level features (e.g., edges in an image), while deeper layers compose these to extract high-level features (e.g., shapes or patterns).

Feature extraction fundamentally improves model performance. It can lower computational costs, decrease noise, improve training time, and enhance overall model accuracy and interpretability. However, feature extraction is as much an art as a science and often requires domain knowledge for excellent results.
