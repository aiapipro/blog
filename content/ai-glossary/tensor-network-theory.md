### Summary
Tensor Network Theory is a framework used in machine learning to deal effectively with high-dimensional data, using nodes and links in a graph-like structure. This mathematical structure uses tensor computations to model and solve problems where traditional methods struggle due to high computational complexity.

### ELI5
Think of Tensor Network Theory as a smart way of organizing and sorting lego blocks (which we can call tensors) so that you can quickly find what you're looking for without having to go through each block. This is especially helpful when you have a lot of blocks!

### In-depth explanation
In machine learning and AI, data is often represented using tensors, which are generalizations of matrices to higher dimensions. These tensors can be thought of as multidimensional arrays of numbers, and can capture complex patterns in the data.

Meanwhile, managing high-dimensional data can often be computationally complex and prohibitive. This is known as the “curse of dimensionality.” The Tensor Network Theory provides a way to handle such high-dimensional data more efficiently.

Often in high-dimensional data, there exist important correlations between certain data attributes that can be mapped into a compressed network structure that efficiently encapsulates these correlations. Tensor Network Theory allows us to construct such a structure effectively.

In the tensor network structure, each tensor is represented as a node and the dimensions of the tensors they share are represented as links connecting these nodes. Each link encodes a dependency relationship in the multidimensional data mapped onto this network. 

It is notable that transformations between tensors in these networks are usually defined in a way that preserves crucial meanings in the data. This opens up the possibility of using tensor network methods to encode, analyze and decode information more efficiently.

Tensor Network Theory fundamentally challenges the traditional methods, by reducing the computational complexity through the graphical symbols, tensor contractions, and factorizations. They provide superior ways to represent quantum states, quantum computing algorithms, and could also help improve classical machine learning methods. These capabilities could offer great capabilities for future AI applications.
