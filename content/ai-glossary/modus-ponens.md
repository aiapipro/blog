### Summary

Modus Ponens is a fundamental rule of inference in logic. It refers to the process where, given two propositions, if the first implies the second and the first is true, we can conclude the second is also true.

### ELI5

Imagine you're about to go play in the park, but your mom tells you two things: "If it is raining then you must take an umbrella" and "It is raining". So, you must take an umbrella, right? Congratulations, you just applied Modus Ponens without knowing it!

### In-depth explanation

Modus Ponens (also known as the law of detachment or affirming the antecedent) is a basic rule in propositional logic and natural deduction. It describes the deductive reasoning process where, given two propositions, if the first proposition implies the second, and the first proposition is known to be true, then the second must also be true. It's one of the primary logical foundations used in systems of automated reasoning in artificial intelligence (AI).

Modus Ponens can be represented as follows:
1. P -> Q
2. P
Therefore, Q

In this formula, P and Q are propositional variables, symbolically representing sentences or propositions. The arrow (->) signifies "implies." That is, if P is true, then Q is also true. 

AI systems use Modus Ponens in the reasoning process to make valid deductions given a rule base and known truths. In practical AI applications, this might come into play in a rule-based system where the inference engine needs to make a decision or deduction based on the existing knowledge base. For example, in a healthcare AI system, the rule base might contain relationships such as 'If symptoms include X, Y, and Z, then illness is A.' Here X, Y, Z are symptoms (P), and A is the illness (Q). If an individual's symptoms include X, Y, and Z (P is true), Modus Ponens allows the AI to deduce that the individual has illness A (Q).

While this form of reasoning is widely used and highly reliable, it's essential to note its limitations. The system must ensure that the "if" statement is true and the causal relationship exists for the Modus Ponens rule to apply accurately.
