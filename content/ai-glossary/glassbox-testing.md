### Summary
Glassbox Testing, also known as white-box or clear-box testing, is an approach where an AI's internal structure, design, and implementation are fully visible to a tester. This insight allows for comprehensive testing, as it's meant to verify the workings of the system against its expected behavior.

### ELI5
Glassbox Testing is like peeking into a clear, see-through robot (the 'glass box') to see how it works on the inside. When it's doing its robot tasks, we can see all the gears and parts moving. By watching closely, we can check if all the parts are working correctly together.

### In-depth explanation
Glassbox Testing involves inspecting the inner workings of an AI model. Unlike black-box testing, where the focus is on input-output relationships, glassbox testing allows a close examination of the code, algorithm, and structure of the model itself. Such granular visibility into the AI system is invaluable for identifying and fixing bugs, improving efficiency, and validating code paths.

In this approach, the tester crafts test cases based on the model's implementation, scrutinizing specific algorithmic decisions, handling of edge conditions, and data flow within the model. For instance, if the model is a decision tree, a tester might examine how the tree splits and for each node, check if the splits are happening as expected. Similarly, for a neural network, one could simulate different inputs and examine the weights and biases of the neurons change.

This practice is great for unit testing, wherein individual code components, such as functions or methods within the AI system, are tested separately. It shines in finding hidden errors within the system that might not be identified when only examining the output. Importantly, glassbox testing paves the way for code optimization by highlighting possible redundancies or inefficiencies, leading to both improved functionality and computational efficiency.

As valuable as it is, glassbox testing has its complexities. It requires a deep understanding of the AI system's internal structure and logic, and can be time-consuming. The effectiveness of this testing also heavily depends on the set of test cases used. Too few or ineffective test scenarios might not fully unveil hidden bugs. Further, some parts of AI systems, like those involving stochastic methods, might prove challenging to test. 

In summary, glassbox testing is a robust way of fine-tuning an AI system. It leverages the visibility of internal algorithms, model design, and implementation to ensure the system is functioning as intended. Although it might pose substantial challenges, its use can greatly enhance the internal cohesion and external reliability of AI systems.
