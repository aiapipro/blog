### Summary
Connectionism is a concept in AI and cognitive science inspired by the human brain. It underpins the creation of Artificial Neural Networks, emphasizing the complex, parallel, and distributed nature of cognitive processes.

### ELI5
Imagine if your brain was a big city, where every building is a neuron, and all the pathways linking them are the connections. In your brain city, information (like where you left your toys) travels along these pathways between buildings. The better the connections, the easier it is to remember where you left your toys. Connectionism works the same way. It's a way to build artificial brains (computers) that can learn just like you do!

### In-depth Explanation
Connectionism is a theory that suggests intelligence can arise from the connections between simple processing nodes, akin to how cognitive processes in the human brain arise out of connections between neurons. These processing nodes, or 'neurons', are not complex by themselves. Their power derives from their interconnectedness, just like a simple neuron in the brain.

In the context of artificial intelligence, connectionism finds application in the design of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) - computational models inspired by the human neural structure. ANNs are composed of computing units (artificial neurons) modeled after the biological neurons. The neurons are grouped into distinct layers: an input layer, one or more 'hidden' layers, and an output layer. Each neuron takes a number of weighted inputs, processes it by a nonlinear function (usually an activation function), and outputs the result. The synapses, or connections, correspond to the weights in ANNs, determining the strength or intensity of the signal that the connection transmits.

A key aspect of Connectionism in neural networks is this ability to learn. The primary mechanism is through adjustment of the synaptic weights based on the input and output patterns â€’ a process called backpropagation. This learning process involves minimizing a loss function which yields the error between the network's predicted and actual outputs, using a technique called gradient descent. 

It's important to note the difference between connectionism and symbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI). While symbolic AI aims to achieve intelligence by manipulating symbols according to rules, connectionism is sub-symbolic, emphasizing numeric computation. Symbolic AI operates with explicit rules and distinct, well-defined symbols, while connectionist models draw upon statistical patterns from inputs and adjust their internal representations (weights) to improve their predictions.

In essence, Connectionism offers a computational model that relies on processing simplicity, numeric inputs, and the structure of connections. It forms the backbone of many AI applications today, from image recognition to natural language processing, enabling them to learn from the underlying patterns in data and make intelligent decisions.
