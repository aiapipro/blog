### Summary
Automata Theory is a key branch of theoretical computer science, exploring abstract self-operating machines (automata) and computations they perform. It sets foundations for programming languages and serves as a basis for the study of computation and artificial intelligence.

### ELI5
Imagine a factory with a complicated machine that makes toys. You insert plastic blocks and screws into the machine, and following a specific series of steps, it turns them into a toy car. The factory machine is like an 'automaton' in Automata Theory!

### In-depth explanation
Automata theory is the study of abstract machines, also known as 'automata', and the mathematical computations that can be done using these structures. An automaton can be conceived as a mathematical model, a system that receives inputs, through which it goes through a series of states and produces an output, following a defined set of rules.

The simplest form of an automaton is Finite Automaton (FA). They possess a finite number of states and are used to recognize patterns within input taken from a finite set of symbols. FAs can be deterministic (DFAs), where every state has precisely one transition for each possible input, or non-deterministic (NFAs), where a state can have zero, one, or multiple transitions for a given input symbol.

Pushdown Automaton (PDA) is a type of automaton that employs a stack to remember information, enabling it to recognize context-free languages, specifically useful in parsing certain patterns of programming languages.

More complex is the Turing Machine, a theoretical model that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. It's a fundamental concept in computational theory, and every digital computer is a physical realization of a Turing Machine.

Automata theory plays a crucial role in AI. For example, finite automata can be used in natural language processing to build morphological parsers. Hidden Markov Models, an evolution of finite automata, are used in speech recognition. Automata's power to formalize machine behavior renders it a vital tool in AI safety, defining formal boundaries on AI systems' behavior.
