### Summary
The Junction Tree Algorithm is a computational algorithm predominantly used in probabilistic graphical models. It simplifies complex, large-scale causal and probabilistic reasoning into easy-to-manage computations. This algorithm is specific to models called Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs).

### ELI5
Imagine you're trying to solve a really big puzzle, but some pieces are missing, and you need to find a way to complete it. Junction Tree Algorithm is like a strategy you can use. It groups your puzzle pieces (information) into clusters or 'trees' to help you understand how it all fits together, figure out what is likely to happen next, and fill in the missing pieces.

### In-depth explanation
Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) are a type of model frequently used in AI for understanding causality and uncertainty. PGMs decompose complex multivariate distributions into products of local distributions. This makes inference tractable even on large scales. A key aspect of PGMs is efficient inference.

The Junction Tree Algorithm, which is sometimes also referred to as the 'Join Tree' or 'Clique Tree' algorithm, can be viewed as a process that transforms a graphical model into a tree architecture, where these trees are clusters consisting of various model variables with a local moralized scope. These tree architectures are known as junction trees.

Junction trees have the property that any two clusters with a common variable are interconnected via clusters that also have this variable. This means if we perform operations on clusters in a particular sequence, called message-passing, the computed probabilities get updated consistently.

The algorithm generally follows a three-step process. The first step is called moralization, where you convert the graph into a so-called "moral graph". In a moral graph, all the parents of a same child node are connected together. The second step is triangulation, where you eliminate loops in the graph which are four nodes or more. The final step is building the junction tree from the triangle graph.

By executing the Junction Tree Algorithm, we obtain a framework for executing other probabilistic queries efficiently. Therefore, this algorithm significantly contributes to the overall scalability and utility of Probabilistic Graphical Models in varied applications across AI and machine learning.
