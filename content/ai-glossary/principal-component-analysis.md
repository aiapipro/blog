### Summary
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that simplifies complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. It does this by transforming the data into fewer dimensions, which often represent underlying processes.

### ELI5
Imagine you are at a party with lots of chatter. There are many conversations happening that make the overall sound complex. PCA is like a sharp listener who can single out one or two voices or topics that stand out above the rest. It focuses on these main voices, helping to simplify and understand the overall chatter. 

### In-depth explanation
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in Machine Learning and data analysis. It can be viewed as a method which projects high dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace, ensuring that the variance of the projected data is maximized.

Given a set of points in a high-dimensional space, PCA tries to find the direction (or directions) in which the points vary the most. These directions are called principal components. The first principal component is the direction of maximum variance, the second principal component is the direction of the second most variance, orthogonal to the first, and so on.

PCA works by first computing the covariance matrix of the original dataset. The covariance matrix captures the variance and the correlation among the variables in the dataset. Then it computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. Here, the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector.

PCA's strength is its ability to handle multicollinearity (highly correlated predictors) in data. It can leverage these correlation structures to represent the data in a compact form efficiently. It's beneficial when dealing with high-dimensional data as it can reduce the dimensions without losing significant information.

In terms of coding, PCA can be easily implemented using Python's Scikit-learn library using the PCA class in the decomposition module.

Here's an example using Scikit-learn's PCA:

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Assume X is your high-dimensional dataset
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_transformed = pca.fit_transform(X)

In the above example, 'n_components=2' parameter indicates that we want to reduce our high dimensional data down to two dimensions.
