### Summary
Cold-start is a situation that arises in recommendation systems when we don't have any historic data about users or items. This makes it challenging to provide accurate and personalized recommendations.

### ELI5
Imagine you enter a new book store for the first time, and the storekeeper knows nothing about your book preferences. It's tricky for them to suggest any books you might like. This is like a 'Cold-Start' problem in AI.

### In-depth explanation
In the field of AI, particularly in the realm of recommendation engines, dealing with the cold-start issue is an important aspect. The term cold-start refers to situations where the system is required to make decisions in the absence of any prior knowledge or data, thus, lacks a history from which to learn and make predictions.

This issue primarily arises in two scenarios: user cold-start and item cold-start. User cold-start is when a new user joins the system and there's no previous behavioral data for that user. It becomes challenging to provide personalized recommendations to the new user since their preferences are unknown. Item cold-start, on the other hand, is when a new item is introduced in the system. There's no user interaction data available for that item, which makes it hard to recommend it to the appropriate users.

One common solution to this problem is to use well-understood and interpretable user or item features to build an initial model. For user cold-starts, demographic or other provided information can be used. Similarly, in case of item cold-starts, item meta-data or features can be utilized. However, these methods have their limitations and may not achieve the desired level of personalization.

Another approach for dealing with cold-start problems employs collaborative filtering, especially its hybrid models that combine several different types of information. These methods are particularly effective when only scarce behavioral data is available. Hybrid methods often perform better than standalone algorithms when dealing with new users or items.

It is also worth noting that cold-start is not a standalone problem but is embedded within the broader framework of machine learning models and AI applications. Thus, there's no one-size-fits-all solution and the choice of appropriate methods is highly dependent on application domain, available data, and specific user requirements.
