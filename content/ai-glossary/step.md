### Summary
In artificial intelligence, a step refers to a single iteration in a given process, such as during algorithm execution or learning. It is a fundamental building block of procedural, iterative tasks and is crucial in optimizing models and solving problems.

### ELI5
Suppose you're baking a cake following a recipe. Each action you do - like mixing ingredients, putting it in the oven, or icing the cake - could be considered as a step. Similarly, in AI, a step is like a single action or instruction the computer follows when learning from data or solving problems.

### In-depth explanation
In the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, a "step" often refers to an individual iteration or operation performed by an algorithm. It's a crucial unit of process, analogous to a single move in a chess game, or an individual action in following a recipe.

The most common application of steps is found within iterative optimization techniques used for training AI models, such as gradient descent. Here, a step represents a single iteration where the model parameters are adjusted slightly in the direction that reduces the error. Each step moves the model closer to the optimum, improving its predictive accuracy.

In reinforcement learning, a step refers to an agent making a decision and moving from one state to another. The agent takes an action (step) in the environment, receives some feedback (reward), and uses this feedback to update its understanding of the world.

Steps also play a crucial role in search problems. In an AI program attempting to solve a problem by exploring a state space (such as a pathfinding algorithm seeking the shortest route between two points), a step would refer to the transition from one state to another in the search space.

A step's "size" can often be adjusted and plays an important role in controlling the learning process in many AI algorithms. For example, in gradient descent, the learning rate parameter determines the size of the steps. Smaller steps lead to slower, but potentially more precise convergence, whereas larger steps might converge faster, but risk overshooting the optimum.

Lastly, in the context of sequence prediction tasks (like language translation and speech recognition), a step can also refer to the progression of computations in a sequence. For instance, in a recurrent neural network (RNN) processing a sentence, a step would typically denote the processing of a single word or character.
