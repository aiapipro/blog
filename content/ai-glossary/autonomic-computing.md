### Summary
Autonomic Computing refers to the self-management capabilities of computing systems, inspired by the autonomic nervous system of the human body. It aims to create systems capable of running themselves, adjusting to varying circumstances, and preparing their operations without human interference.

### ELI5
Imagine you're playing a video game where you have to manage a whole city. It's a tough job as you have to take care of electricity, roads, schools, and more. Now, think about a city that can manage itself, fixing its own problems, maintaining order, and improving over time, while you just watch it growing. That's what Autonomic Computing is like -- it's about creating computer systems that can manage themselves on their own.

### In-depth explanation
Autonomic Computing is a concept in artificial intelligence that represents the wide-ranging effort to develop systems capable of self-management. In essence, it encompasses the design of computing systems that require minimal human intervention, are self-configurable, self-optimizing, self-healing, and self-protecting.

The term owes its origins to the word 'autonomic', derived from human biology, where the autonomic nervous system controls essential body functions such as heartbeat, breathing, and digestion without conscious effort.

An autonomic system is characterized by four main properties:

1. Self-Configuration: The system should be able to adapt according to the environment and configure itself appropriately. The self-configuring ability is about adjusting to the constantly changing conditions and preparing the operations to optimize system performance.

2. Self-Optimization: The system should constantly monitor its operational parameters and adjust them for optimal operation. This process is not only tied to system legislation but also to ensure efficiency and quality service.

3. Self-Healing: The system should have the ability to diagnose and fix issues on its own. This includes detecting system malfunctions, predicting potential faults, taking preventive measures, and taking corrective actions when a fault occurs.

4. Self-Protection: The system should be able to detect and protect itself from various threats or attacks by reinforcing its security measures and making necessary arrangements.

Autonomic Computing is an integrated part of machine learning and artificial intelligence, where learning algorithms are used to gather knowledge about the system behavior and state to make decisions and guide the system towards its objectives.

In the context of machine learning, autonomic systems can be built using reinforcement learning techniques, where the system learns from its own experience and makes decisions that result in positive outcomes. The system learns a policy that leads to actions maximizing the long-term reward or minimizing the long-term cost.

The development of autonomic systems has opened the door to many applications in various spheres from self-driving cars, smart homes, and healthcare systems to large-scale cloud computing infrastructures and data centers.
