### Summary
Adversarial Testing in AI refers to a technique used to evaluate the robustness of machine learning models. It involves purposely creating adversarial examples, input data designed to cause the model to make mistakes, to understand and improve the model's performance in unexpected scenarios.

### ELI5
Imagine a teacher who wants to make sure a student really understands how to read. The teacher might give the student a word that looks similar but is not exactly the same as a word they learned. If the student recognizes it as a different word, it shows they really know how to read, not just memorize. Similarly, in Adversarial Testing, we give an AI model slightly altered examples to check if it really understands the patterns in the data and does not just memorize them.

### In-depth explanation
Adversarial Testing is an indispensable tool in the arsenal of AI developers for evaluating the robustness and reliability of different types of machine learning models, especially those employed in high-stakes scenarios like self-driving cars or facial recognition systems.

The process involves creating 'adversarial examples', which are intentionally modified instances of input data crafted to mislead the model into making incorrect predictions. These adversarial examples oftentimes exhibit only slight perturbations from the original data, imperceptible to human observers, yet enough to confuse the AI model.

The key objective of adversarial testing is to assess the model's performance in the face of such deceptive inputs and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. By doing so, it ascertains that the model generalizes well and does not merely overfit to the training data.

The validity of adversarial testing is centered on the concept of 'adversarial robustness', which refers to a model's capability of preserving the correctness of its outputs when its inputs are slightly tweaked. This is a crucial attribute for any AI system functioning in the real world since it invariably encounters variations in the input data. 

In the context of deep learning, the creation of adversarial examples is often facilitated by understanding the model's gradient information, which describes the sensitivity of its outputs to changes in the inputs and can therefore be leveraged to find subtle perturbations that might fool the model. Popular methods include the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD).

While adversarial testing helps unmask weaknesses in a model, it also guides the path for enhancing its adversarial robustness. Potential measures involve strategies like adversarial training, where the model is trained on a mix of clean and adversarial examples to learn from its mistakes, and defensive distillation, which attempts to make the model's learning process inherently less sensitive to perturbations.
