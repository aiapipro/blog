### Summary
Cognitive Architecture is a blueprint for intelligent agents. It represents the underlying structure of intelligent systems including human consciousness, incorporating aspects of cognition like memory, reasoning, and perception.

### ELI5
Think of Cognitive Architecture like the brain of a robot. Just like our brain allows us to think, remember stuff, and understand things, cognitive architecture allows machines to do the same.

### In-depth explanation
Cognitive Architecture is a complex, comprehensive system that structures the implementation and design of intelligent agents. This design incorporates both architectural components, which serve as a foundation for the system's capabilities, as well as algorithms and mechanisms that actually carry out the higher-order cognitive processes.

Taking inspiration from human cognition, these architectures guide the imitation of human thought processes in machines. This involves incorporating elements of perception, learning, language comprehension, problem-solving, reasoning, and even consciousness. The end goal is to create systems that can understand, learn, and react to complex real-world scenarios.

Cognitive architectures can be broadly classified into two categories. Symbolic architectures, like SOAR and ACT-R, use symbols to represent knowledge, and operations on these symbols constitute cognition. On the other hand, connectionist or sub-symbolic architectures, like Neural Networks, perform cognition through the alteration of connection weights between nodes.

Cognitive architectures also incorporate various types of memory, including short-term and long-term memory, enabling the machines to learn from past experiences. The control structure determines when and how the different modules activate and interact. For example, in rule-based systems, production rules determine which action to take under what circumstances.

These architectures not only provide a theoretical foundation to understand intelligence but also deliver practical constructs for constructing intelligent systems. However, despite progress, there remains a substantial gap between the complexity of human cognition and the capabilities of current cognitive architecture, a challenge that drives continued research and development in the field.
