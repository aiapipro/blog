Imagine if you had a really smart friend who could learn and play any game you liked, even the ones that are really, really tricky. That's what DeepMind is like - it's a company that built a super-smart computer system that can learn and get really good at lots of different things!

### In-depth explanation

DeepMind Technologies is a pioneering artificial intelligence research laboratory based out of London, UK. Founded in 2010, the organization was acquired by Google in 2014 and later became a part of the Alphabet Inc. conglomerate. DeepMind describes its mission as "solving intelligence and then using that to solve everything else."

DeepMind has made significant contributions to the field of AI. They've moved the needle significantly on AI research via reinforcement learning, where an AI is trained like a child, learning through trial and error. Their advances owe much to this technique, where AIs learn to maximize rewards gained through right decisions and minimize punishments from wrong ones.

DeepMind's most public achievement was the development of AlphaGo, an AI program which, in 2016, defeated the world champion Go player Lee Sedol. Go is an ancient Asian game with more possible moves than atoms in the universe, making brute-force prediction impossible. This marked a significant breakthrough in AI, as the program had to incorporate a level of intuition and strategy that had not been seen before in AI.

Following AlphaGo, DeepMind has developed other AI systems like AlphaZero, which can play and master several games such as Go, chess, and shogi without any prior rules. More recently, DeepMind introduced AlphaFold, which made a significant breakthrough in predicting protein folding, providing a solution to a problem that has puzzled biologists for decades. This could have far-reaching implications in drug discovery and disease understanding.

While DeepMind's advances in AI have been impressive, they also bring up ethical and societal implications. From AI's impact on jobs to its use in warfare to privacy concerns, DeepMind and the field of AI at large must navigate these challenges.
