### Summary
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is the hypothetical future form of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, adapt and implement knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equivalent to a human being. The term encapsulates the ambition of creating machines that can handle any intellectual task that a human can do.

### ELI5
Imagine if a robot could not only help you tidy your room, but also do your homework, paint a picture, cook your favourite meal, and even discuss a book you just read. This robot can learn new things and understand them just like you, instead of being programmed to do just specific tasks. That is kind of what Artificial General Intelligence is - like a very, very smart robot friend who can do and understand lots of different things, just like a human can.

### In-depth explanation
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents the vision of a machine capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do. It is the kind of AI that can understand, learn, plan, and execute a wide range of activities independently and flexibly. AGI can find solutions to unfamiliar problems in unfamiliar contexts through reasoning, learning from experience, understanding complex ideas, and utilizing knowledge from different domains.

This differs from Narrow Artificial Intelligence (NAI), which is designed for specific tasks like speech recognition, image processing, or recommendation systems. NAI cannot transfer knowledge from one domain to another - for instance, an AI designed for chess does not understand how to play checkers - and cannot handle tasks outside of their specific domain.

What sets AGI apart is its hypothesized ability to generalize knowledge from one domain to others, a characteristic at the essence of human intelligence. Today's AI, whether it's autonomous vehicles, voice assistants, or recommendation systems, do not possess this sort of general intelligence, and are examples of NAI.

Designing AGI presents significant challenges and is a topic of ongoing research. Neuroscientists and computer scientists alike are working to understand the human brain and mimic its processes in creating intelligent machines, while others explore different computational approaches to achieve the same. 

Key methodologies to achieve AGI include symbolic approaches (such as GOFAI or "Good Old Fashioned AI"), connectionism (neural networks), probabilistic inference (Bayesian networks), and combinations thereof. Some believe that once a certain level of artificial intelligence is reached, through machine learning techniques or otherwise, AGI could improve its own capabilities (a concept known as 'recursive self-improvement'), possibly leading to an intelligence explosion.

While AGI holds significant promise, it also poses ethical, safety, and policy challenges that need to be carefully addressed.
