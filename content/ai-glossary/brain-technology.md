Apologies for the confusion but I couldn't find any information corresponding to "Brain Technology" specifically in the context of AI/ML. The term, as it stands, is overly broad and could refer to multiple things, ranging from neurobiology to Brain-Computer Interface technologies. 

Please could you provide a narrower, more specific term or a brief context so that I could give a comprehensive and meaningful glossary entry?
