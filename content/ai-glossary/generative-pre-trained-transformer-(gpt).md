### Summary
Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) is a form of artificial intelligence that utilizes machine learning to produce human-like text. It is designed to generate written content by predicting the next word in a sentence, given all the previous words.

### ELI5
Imagine you're playing a game where you have to guess the next word in a story. All you have are the words that have already been said. The GPT AI does just that! It uses a bag of tricks (algorithms) to make very educated guesses about what word comes next. This helps it to write text that looks like it was written by a human. 

### In-depth explanation
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) refers to an architecture in machine learning based on transformer models. Transformers themselves came as a leap-forward kind of model in Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, allowing handling of long-term dependencies in text and efficient batch-learning process.

GPT model, produced by OpenAI, employs unsupervised learning: it's trained on a large corpus of text from the internet, learning to predict the next word in a sentence. However, the unique factor is that it is generative and pre-trained. The model is first "pre-trained" where it learns to predict a word given the previous words in a sentence, a task known as causal language modeling. This process helps the model to learn about various domains and various features of language itself without having to label data specifically.

Another essential feature of GPT is its generative aspect. Unlike classification models which predict a label for an input, GPT can generate new text, sharing the underlying statistical characteristics of the training data. This enables it to create human-like text passages given some initial input, be it a single word or a sentence.

GPT and its successors (currently up to GPT-3) are a big step forward in the AI's abilities to generate coherent, contextually appropriate written material. It enables various applications from translation, Q&A systems, and even writing articles.

The core technology behind GPTs is the use of transformer models, particularly self-attention mechanisms. These offer substantial benefits over past models including the ability to handle long-term dependencies in text by promoting direct connections between distant words.

Despite being a powerful tool, it's also important to have a note on its limitations. GPT has no understanding or consciousness of the text it's generating, it simply reproduces patterns it learned during training. This can lead to it generating biased, incorrect or nonsensical outputs if such patterns exist in the training data.
