### Summary
The IEEE Computational Intelligence Society is a professional society operated under IEEE that is devoted to the theory, design, application, and development of computational intelligence. It primarily focuses on topics like neural networks, fuzzy systems, and evolutionary computation.

### ELI5
Think of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society as a big club for scientists and engineers who love making machines smart. They all work together to figure out how to make computers think more like humans, learn from their mistakes, and solve problems all on their own.

### In-depth explanation
The IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS), a sub-group within the broader IEEE organization, is a professional community of researchers, educators, and practitioners who are interested in the theory and applications of computational intelligence. Their efforts are aimed at facilitating cross-disciplinary research and development, promoting computational intelligence as a distinct scientific discipline, and providing forums like conferences, journals, and technical committees for knowledge sharing and professional networking.

Computational intelligence is a subset of artificial intelligence that emphasizes the development of intelligent systems using nature-inspired computing approaches. The CIS primarily focuses on three components: neural networks, fuzzy systems, and evolutionary computation.

Neural networks are computing systems designed to mimic the human brain's structure and function, with the aim of recognizing patterns and making predictions or decisions based on input data. 

Fuzzy systems are a form of logic that deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed or exact. It's used in machine learning to handle issues of uncertainty and complexities in data, providing a foundation for decision-making systems that need to work in uncertain and vague environments. 

Evolutionary computation is a family of algorithms for global optimization inspired by biological evolution, such as genetics, selection, and genetic drift. These as well are aimed at intelligent system development and research.

CIS organizes and supports a range of conferences and workshops across the globe, which serve as platforms for the scientific community to exchange ideas, showcase their research, and build connections. In addition, the society publishes several high-impact journals, including the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, and IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation.

CIS also contributes to and oversees various technical committees, each dedicated to a specific area of computational intelligence. These committees are essential in driving the evolution of Computational Intelligence, shaping standard practices, and promoting innovation.

Taking together all these activities, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society is a key role player in the advancement of computational intelligence globally and its adaptation to real-world applications, be it industries, business, or scientific research.
