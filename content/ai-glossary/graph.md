### Summary
A Graph in the context of AI refers to a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects. It consists of "nodes" representing the objects and "edges" reflecting the relations, making it imperative for data representation and algorithms like Graph-based Neural Networks or Graph Convolutional Networks.

### ELI5
Imagine your group of friends where everyone knows somebody. In this situation, each person (including you) is like a dot, or node, and each friendship is like a line, or edge, connecting two dots. This whole friendship map can be thought of as a 'Graph'. In AI, we use this concept to show relationships between things.

### In-depth explanation
The architecture of a Graph is composed of vertices, also known as nodes, which are the primary objects of study, and edges, which are pairs of these nodes. The edges might be directed (depicting a one-way connection), as in a Directed Graph or Digraph, or undirected, as in an Undirected Graph. 

Interesting subjects for study in graph theory include the Graph's connectivity characteristics, distribution of degree (the number of edges attached to a node), and dense or sparse characterizations. 

In AI, graphs offer an elegant way to depict relationships between entities, particularly when the relationships are complex and non-hierarchical. This is especially handy in Natural Language Processing when constructing knowledge graphs or semantic networks, and in Computer Vision for object recognition and object relation tasks.

One potent application of graphs in AI is the Graph-based Neural Network (GNN). GNNs are designed to handle graph structure data, like social networks, molecular graphs, and recommendation systems. They carry out feature learning for each node considering the nodeâ€™s local neighborhood defined by the graph structure. 

There are several variations of graph neural networks, including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), each with unique consolidation mechanisms.
