### Summary
An Autonomous System refers to a system in AI that is capable of performing tasks independently, without continuous human intervention. It bases its decision-making abilities on inputs from its environment, using algorithms to interpret these inputs.

### ELI5
Imagine you have a smart robot toy. You just have to switch it on and it starts exploring your house on its own. It might stumble into a wall, but it learns and next time it turns to avoid the wall. This is like an Autonomous System. It can do things on its own, learn from its actions, and doesn't need your constant help.

### In-depth explanation
In AI terminology, an Autonomous System refers to advanced systems that can function independently, without continuous oversight or commands from a user. These systems can adapt to new situations and perform actions or make decisions based on their programming and the data they encounter. 

A key aspect of an Autonomous System is its capability to learn from and interpret its surrounding environment and inputs. This is often achieved via Machine Learning (ML) techniques, such as reinforcement learning and deep learning, where the system is trained to make decisions based on the data it is provided, and continually optimizes its performance over time.

Another important feature is an autonomous systemâ€™s ability to operate in dynamic and unpredictable environments. An example would be autonomous vehicles, which must react to rapidly changing road conditions, traffic patterns, and obstacles.

In addition, Autonomous Systems often employ advanced algorithms for tasks such as planning and scheduling. For instance, in autonomous drones, the systems would need to plan the most optimal routes and adjust to changing conditions like weather or obstructed paths.

It's important to understand that although the term "autonomous" suggests full independence, most real-world autonomous systems still operate under certain boundaries set by their human creators. For example, an AI used for financial trading may be able to make trades autonomously within certain timeframes or risk parameters set by the trader.

Lastly, although Autonomous Systems do not require human intervention to operate, they often work alongside humans in a cooperative manner. This cooperative human-AI interaction helps balance automation's efficiency with human creativity and critical thinking, ultimately improving overall system performance.
